Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store1      | int     |
| store2      | int     |
| store3      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores: store1, store2, and store3.
If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
```

Write a solution to rearrange the `Products` table so that each row has `(product_id, store, price)`. If a product is not available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0          | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1          | 70     | null   | 80     |
+------------+--------+--------+--------+
Output:
+------------+--------+-------+
| product_id | store  | price |
+------------+--------+-------+
| 0          | store1 | 95    |
| 0          | store2 | 100   |
| 0          | store3 | 105   |
| 1          | store1 | 70    |
| 1          | store3 | 80    |
+------------+--------+-------+
Explanation:
Product 0 is available in all three stores with prices 95, 100, and 105 respectively.
Product 1 is available in store1 with price 70 and store3 with price 80. The product is not available in store2.
```

# Rearranging Product Store Data into Rows

To solve this problem, I need to transform the wide format table (with store columns) into a long format table (with store rows), while excluding any product-store combinations where the price is NULL.

## Approach

1. **Unpivot Data**: Convert columns (store1, store2, store3) into rows
2. **Filter NULL Prices**: Exclude any rows where the price is NULL
3. **Select Columns**: Include product_id, store name, and price in the result

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    'store1' AS store,
    store1 AS price
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    store1 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
    product_id,
    'store2' AS store,
    store2 AS price
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    store2 IS NOT NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
    product_id,
    'store3' AS store,
    store3 AS price
FROM
    Products
WHERE
    store3 IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    product_id, store;
```

## Explanation

1. The solution uses three separate SELECT queries (one for each store) combined with UNION ALL
2. Each query:
    - Selects the product_id
    - Creates a store column with the store name
    - Selects the corresponding store price
    - Filters out NULL prices with WHERE clause
3. UNION ALL combines all non-NULL store prices into a single result set
4. The final ORDER BY organizes results by product_id and store name
5. In the example:
    - Product 0 has prices in all three stores (all included)
    - Product 1 has NULL in store2 (excluded), but includes store1 and store3 prices

This solution effectively transforms the data structure while handling NULL values appropriately.
