**Description**

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
```

Write a solution to find `employee_id` of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers **will not exceed three managers** as the company is small.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id 1.
The employees with employee_id 2 and 77 report their work directly to the head of the company.
The employee with employee_id 4 reports their work indirectly to the head of the company 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employee with employee_id 7 reports their work indirectly to the head of the company 7 --> 4 --> 2 --> 1.
The employees with employee_id 3, 8, and 9 do not report their work to the head of the company directly or indirectly.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Two Joins**

We can use two joins to find all employees who report directly or indirectly to the company CEO.

Specifically, we first use a join to find the `manager_id` of the superior manager for each `manager_id`, and then use another join to find the `manager_id` of the higher-level manager. Finally, if the `manager_id` of the higher-level manager is 1 and the `employee_id` of the employee is not 1, it means that the employee reports directly or indirectly to the company CEO.

## Problem Understanding

We need to find all employees who directly or indirectly report to the company head (employee_id = 1), where:

- Direct reports: Employees whose manager_id = 1
- Indirect reports: Employees who report to someone who ultimately reports to employee_id 1
- The depth of management hierarchy is at most 3 levels

## Query Analysis

```SQL
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM
    Employees AS e1
    JOIN Employees AS e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
    JOIN Employees AS e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
WHERE e1.employee_id != 1 AND e3.manager_id = 1;
```

This SQL query uses self-joins to traverse the management hierarchy. Let me break it down:

### Self-Joins Explained

1. **First self-join**: `JOIN Employees AS e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id`
    - Links each employee to their direct manager
    - e1 represents employees
    - e2 represents their direct managers
2. **Second self-join**: `JOIN Employees AS e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id`
    - Links each manager to their manager (2nd level up)
    - e3 represents the managers of the managers

### WHERE Clause Logic

- `e1.employee_id != 1`: Excludes the company head (who reports to themselves)
- `e3.manager_id = 1`: Only includes employees whose "manager's manager" reports to the company head

### Detailed Execution Flow

Let's trace how this works with our example data:

1. For each employee in e1:
    - Find their manager in e2
    - Find their manager's manager in e3
    - Check if their manager's manager reports to the CEO (employee_id = 1)
2. The query captures:
    - Level 2 employees: Those whose manager is the CEO (e2.manager_id = 1)
    - Level 3 employees: Those whose manager's manager is the CEO (e3.manager_id = 1)

### Missing Direct Reports

One key insight: This query doesn't catch direct reports to the CEO! The WHERE clause `e3.manager_id = 1` requires going through at least two levels of management.

To fix this, we would need another approach that captures all three possible scenarios:

1. Direct reports to CEO
2. Reports to someone who reports to CEO
3. Reports to someone who reports to someone who reports to CEO

## Alternative More Complete Solution

A better solution would use a UNION approach or a recursive CTE to capture all levels properly:

```SQL
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE manager_id = 1 AND employee_id != 1
UNION
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
WHERE e2.manager_id = 1 AND e1.employee_id != 1
UNION
SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
JOIN Employees e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
WHERE e3.manager_id = 1 AND e1.employee_id != 1;
```

## Issues with the Original Query

Given the example output, the original query doesn't match the expected results. The query only returns indirect reports that are exactly 2 levels down from the CEO.

For employee 4, who reports to 2, who reports to 1:

- The query works: e1 = 4, e2 = 2, e3 = 1, and e3.manager_id = 1

But for employee 2, who directly reports to 1:

- The query fails because there's no manager chain of length 2 above employee 2

## Conclusion

The given query is incomplete as it only captures employees who are exactly 2 levels below the CEO. It misses direct reports to the CEO (like employee 2 and 77) and reports that are 3 levels down (like employee 7).

A correct solution would need to handle all three possible levels of hierarchy as shown in the alternative solution.
