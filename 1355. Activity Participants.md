**Description**

Table: `Friends`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the id of the friend and the primary key for this table in SQL.
name is the name of the friend.
activity is the name of the activity which the friend takes part in.
```

Table: `Activities`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
name is the name of the activity.
```

Find the names of all the activities with neither the maximum nor the minimum number of participants.

Each activity in the `Activities` table is performed by any person in the table Friends.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Friends table:
+------+--------------+---------------+
| id   | name         | activity      |
+------+--------------+---------------+
| 1    | Jonathan D.  | Eating        |
| 2    | Jade W.      | Singing       |
| 3    | Victor J.    | Singing       |
| 4    | Elvis Q.     | Eating        |
| 5    | Daniel A.    | Eating        |
| 6    | Bob B.       | Horse Riding  |
+------+--------------+---------------+
Activities table:
+------+--------------+
| id   | name         |
+------+--------------+
| 1    | Eating       |
| 2    | Singing      |
| 3    | Horse Riding |
+------+--------------+
Output:
+--------------+
| activity     |
+--------------+
| Singing      |
+--------------+
Explanation:
Eating activity is performed by 3 friends, maximum number of participants, (Jonathan D. , Elvis Q. and Daniel A.)
Horse Riding activity is performed by 1 friend, minimum number of participants, (Bob B.)
Singing is performed by 2 friends (Victor J. and Jade W.)
```

I'll analyze the SQL solution for finding activities with neither the maximum nor minimum number of participants.

## Problem Understanding

The task is to:

1. Count how many people participate in each activity
2. Identify activities that don't have the maximum number of participants
3. Identify activities that don't have the minimum number of participants
4. Return activities that satisfy both conditions (neither max nor min)

## Solution Analysis

```SQL
WITH
    t AS (
        SELECT activity, COUNT(1) AS cnt
        FROM Friends
        GROUP BY activity
    )
SELECT activity
FROM t
WHERE cnt > (SELECT MIN(cnt) FROM t) AND cnt < (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM t);
```

### Step 1: Creating a Summary Table with CTE

The solution begins with a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 't':

```SQL
WITH t AS (
    SELECT activity, COUNT(1) AS cnt
    FROM Friends
    GROUP BY activity
)
```

This creates a temporary result set containing:

- Each unique activity name
- The count of friends participating in that activity (`COUNT(1)` counts rows)

For the example data, 't' would contain:

```Plain
+--------------+-----+
| activity     | cnt |
+--------------+-----+
| Eating       | 3   |
| Singing      | 2   |
| Horse Riding | 1   |
+--------------+-----+
```

### Step 2: Filtering for Middle Values

The main query then filters these counts:

```SQL
SELECT activity
FROM t
WHERE cnt > (SELECT MIN(cnt) FROM t) AND cnt < (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM t);
```

This returns activities where:

- The participant count is greater than the minimum count among all activities
- The participant count is less than the maximum count among all activities

In our example:

- MIN(cnt) = 1 (Horse Riding)
- MAX(cnt) = 3 (Eating)
- Only "Singing" with cnt = 2 satisfies both conditions (2 > 1 AND 2 < 3)

## Key Insights

1. **Elegant Use of CTE**: The CTE simplifies the query by pre-calculating counts once
2. **Subqueries for Min/Max**: Using subqueries to find the global min and max values is cleaner than alternatives like window functions
3. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - If all activities have the same number of participants, no results would be returned
    - If there are only two distinct participant counts, no results would be returned
    - We need at least three different participation levels to have a "middle" value
4. **Performance Consideration**: The query is efficient as it only needs to scan the Friends table once to calculate all counts

## Alternative Approaches

We could solve this using window functions:

```SQL
WITH RankedActivities AS (
    SELECT
        activity,
        COUNT(*) AS participant_count,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*)) AS rank_asc,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank_desc
    FROM Friends
    GROUP BY activity
)
SELECT activity
FROM RankedActivities
WHERE rank_asc > 1 AND rank_desc > 1;
```

However, the provided solution is more concise and likely more efficient.

This SQL problem demonstrates how to identify "middle values" in a dataset - a common pattern in data analysis where we need to exclude extremes.
