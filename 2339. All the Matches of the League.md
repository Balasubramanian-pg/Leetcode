**Description**

Table: `Teams`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| team_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
team_name is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row of this table shows the name of a team.
```

Write a solution to report all the possible matches of the  
league. Note that every two teams play two matches with each other,  
with one team being the  
`home_team` once and the other time being the `away_team`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Teams table:
+-------------+
| team_name   |
+-------------+
| Leetcode FC |
| Ahly SC     |
| Real Madrid |
+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+
| home_team   | away_team   |
+-------------+-------------+
| Real Madrid | Leetcode FC |
| Real Madrid | Ahly SC     |
| Leetcode FC | Real Madrid |
| Leetcode FC | Ahly SC     |
| Ahly SC     | Real Madrid |
| Ahly SC     | Leetcode FC |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: All the matches of the league are shown in the table.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to find all possible match combinations between teams
-- Each pair of teams plays twice: once with team A as home and team B as away, and vice versa
-- For n teams, there will be n*(n-1) total matches
```

Explanation: This problem is asking us to create a pairs combination where each team plays against every other team twice - once as the home team and once as the away team. This is essentially a cross join where we exclude matches of a team against itself.

Step 2: Create a Basic Cross Join

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name as home_team,
    t2.team_name as away_team
FROM Teams t1
CROSS JOIN Teams t2
```

Explanation: A cross join produces the Cartesian product of two tables - every row from the first table combined with every row from the second table. This gives us all possible combinations of home and away teams, including matches where a team would play against itself.

Step 3: Exclude Self-Matches

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name as home_team,
    t2.team_name as away_team
FROM Teams t1
CROSS JOIN Teams t2
WHERE t1.team_name != t2.team_name
```

Explanation: We add a WHERE clause to exclude matches where a team would play against itself (where home_team equals away_team). This gives us all valid match combinations for the league.

Step 4: Final Solution

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name as home_team,
    t2.team_name as away_team
FROM Teams t1
CROSS JOIN Teams t2
WHERE t1.team_name != t2.team_name
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Creates a cross join between the Teams table and itself (aliased as t1 and t2)
2. Uses the WHERE clause to exclude matches where a team would play against itself
3. Returns each valid match combination with one team as the home_team and another as the away_team

For each pair of teams (A and B), this will produce two records:

- A as home_team and B as away_team
- B as home_team and A as away_team

This fulfills the requirement that every two teams play two matches with each other.

Final Solution (Alternative with INNER JOIN):

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name as home_team,
    t2.team_name as away_team
FROM Teams t1
INNER JOIN Teams t2 ON t1.team_name != t2.team_name
```

Explanation: This alternative solution achieves the same result using an INNER JOIN with a join condition that excludes self-matches. Both approaches are valid and produce the same output - all possible match combinations for the league.
