**Description**

Table: `Data`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| first_col   | int  |
| second_col  | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
```

Write a solution to independently:

- order `first_col` in **ascending order**.
- order `second_col` in **descending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Data table:
+-----------+------------+
| first_col | second_col |
+-----------+------------+
| 4         | 2          |
| 2         | 3          |
| 3         | 1          |
| 1         | 4          |
+-----------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+------------+
| first_col | second_col |
+-----------+------------+
| 1         | 4          |
| 2         | 3          |
| 3         | 2          |
| 4         | 1          |
+-----------+------------+
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining the logic clearly.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Return all rows from the Data table
2. Order first_col in ascending order (smallest to largest)
3. Order second_col in descending order (largest to smallest)
4. These orderings should be applied independently

The key insight here is that we need to order the two columns independently, not sort the entire rows based on both columns.

## Step 1: Basic approach using row numbers

Let's think about how to order the columns independently. We can use window functions to assign row numbers to each column based on their respective sort orders:

```SQL
WITH FirstColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        first_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY first_col ASC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
),
SecondColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        second_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY second_col DESC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
)
```

Explanation: We create two temporary tables, each with a column ordered as required and a row number indicating its position in the new result set.

## Step 2: Join the ordered columns based on row number

```SQL
WITH FirstColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        first_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY first_col ASC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
),
SecondColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        second_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY second_col DESC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
)
SELECT
    FirstColOrdered.first_col,
    SecondColOrdered.second_col
FROM
    FirstColOrdered
JOIN
    SecondColOrdered ON FirstColOrdered.row_num = SecondColOrdered.row_num;
```

Explanation: We join the two temporary tables on the row number field. This pairs up the ascending first_col values with the descending second_col values.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH FirstColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        first_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY first_col ASC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
),
SecondColOrdered AS (
    SELECT
        second_col,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY second_col DESC) AS row_num
    FROM Data
)
SELECT
    f.first_col,
    s.second_col
FROM
    FirstColOrdered f
JOIN
    SecondColOrdered s ON f.row_num = s.row_num;
```

This query:

1. Creates a temporary table with first_col ordered ascending and row numbers assigned
2. Creates a temporary table with second_col ordered descending and row numbers assigned
3. Joins the two tables on row number to match up the independently ordered columns
4. Returns the combined results with first_col in ascending order and second_col in descending order

The solution handles the independent ordering requirement correctly, even if there are duplicate values in either column.
