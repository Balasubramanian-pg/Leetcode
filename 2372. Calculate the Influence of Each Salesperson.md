**Description**

Table: `Salesperson`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| salesperson_id | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
salesperson_id contains unique values.
Each row in this table shows the ID of a salesperson.
```

Table: `Customer`

```Plain
+----------------+------+
| Column Name    | Type |
+----------------+------+
| customer_id    | int  |
| salesperson_id | int  |
+----------------+------+
customer_id contains unique values.
salesperson_id is a foreign key (reference column) from the Salesperson table.
Each row in this table shows the ID of a customer and the ID of the salesperson.
```

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| sale_id     | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
sale_id contains unique values.
customer_id is a foreign key (reference column) from the Customer table.
Each row in this table shows ID of a customer and the price they paid for the sale with sale_id.
```

Write a solution to report the sum of prices paid by the  
customers of each salesperson. If a salesperson does not have any  
customers, the total value should be  
`0`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Salesperson table:
+----------------+-------+
| salesperson_id | name  |
+----------------+-------+
| 1              | Alice |
| 2              | Bob   |
| 3              | Jerry |
+----------------+-------+
Customer table:
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | salesperson_id |
+-------------+----------------+
| 1           | 1              |
| 2           | 1              |
| 3           | 2              |
+-------------+----------------+
Sales table:
+---------+-------------+-------+
| sale_id | customer_id | price |
+---------+-------------+-------+
| 1       | 2           | 892   |
| 2       | 1           | 354   |
| 3       | 3           | 988   |
| 4       | 3           | 856   |
+---------+-------------+-------+
Output:
+----------------+-------+-------+
| salesperson_id | name  | total |
+----------------+-------+-------+
| 1              | Alice | 1246  |
| 2              | Bob   | 1844  |
| 3              | Jerry | 0     |
+----------------+-------+-------+
Explanation:
Alice is the salesperson for customers 1 and 2.
  - Customer 1 made one purchase with 354.
  - Customer 2 made one purchase with 892.
The total for Alice is 354 + 892 = 1246.

Bob is the salesperson for customers 3.
  - Customer 1 made one purchase with 988 and 856.
The total for Bob is 988 + 856 = 1844.

Jerry is not the salesperson of any customer.
The total for Jerry is 0.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson
-- This requires joining all three tables: Salesperson, Customer, and Sales
-- We need to include all salespersons, even those without customers (total = 0)
```

Explanation: This problem asks us to find the total amount of sales made by each salesperson's customers. We need to link salespersons to their customers, and then sum up all the sales made by those customers. Importantly, we need to include all salespersons in the result, even those who don't have any customers.

Step 2: Link Customers to Salespersons

```SQL
SELECT
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.name,
    c.customer_id
FROM Salesperson sp
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON sp.salesperson_id = c.salesperson_id
```

Explanation: First, we use a LEFT JOIN to connect the Salesperson table with the Customer table. This ensures that all salespersons are included in the result, even those without customers. The LEFT JOIN preserves all rows from the Salesperson table and includes matching rows from the Customer table.

Step 3: Link Customers to Their Sales

```SQL
SELECT
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.name,
    c.customer_id,
    s.price
FROM Salesperson sp
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON sp.salesperson_id = c.salesperson_id
LEFT JOIN Sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
```

Explanation: Now we add another LEFT JOIN to connect customers with their sales. This gives us a row for each sale made by each customer of each salesperson. For salespersons without customers, or customers without sales, the corresponding values will be NULL.

Step 4: Calculate the Total for Each Salesperson

```SQL
SELECT
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(s.price), 0) as total
FROM Salesperson sp
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON sp.salesperson_id = c.salesperson_id
LEFT JOIN Sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
GROUP BY sp.salesperson_id, sp.name
```

Explanation: Finally, we group the results by salesperson_id and name, and use SUM() to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson. We use COALESCE() to replace NULL values with 0, which handles the case where a salesperson has no customers or their customers have no sales.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    sp.salesperson_id,
    sp.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(s.price), 0) as total
FROM Salesperson sp
LEFT JOIN Customer c ON sp.salesperson_id = c.salesperson_id
LEFT JOIN Sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
GROUP BY sp.salesperson_id, sp.name
```

Explanation: This solution:

1. Starts with the Salesperson table to ensure all salespersons are included
2. Uses LEFT JOIN to connect salespersons with their customers
3. Uses another LEFT JOIN to connect customers with their sales
4. Groups the results by salesperson_id and name
5. Calculates the total by summing up all prices, replacing NULL with 0
6. Returns the salesperson_id, name, and total for each salesperson

The query correctly handles all the requirements, including showing a total of 0 for salespersons without any customers.
