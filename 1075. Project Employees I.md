Table: `Project`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key toEmployee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
```

Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table. It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
```

Write an SQL query that reports the **average** experience years of all the employees for each project, **rounded to 2 digits**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00 and for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average experience years of employees for each project. The solution involves joining the `Project` and `Employee` tables, aggregating the experience years by project, and computing the average.

### Approach

1. **Join Tables**: We join the `Project` and `Employee` tables on the `employee_id` column to combine project assignments with employee details.
2. **Aggregate and Calculate Average**: For each project, we sum the experience years of its employees, divide by the number of employees to find the average, and round the result to 2 decimal places.
3. **Result Order**: The problem statement allows the result to be in any order, so no specific ordering is required in the solution.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    Project.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(Employee.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project
JOIN Employee ON Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
GROUP BY Project.project_id;
```

### Explanation

- **JOIN Clause**: The `JOIN` operation combines rows from the `Project` and `Employee` tables based on the matching `employee_id` values. This allows us to access both project assignments and employee experience years in a single query.
- **GROUP BY**: We group the results by `project_id` to calculate the average experience years separately for each project.
- **AVG() and ROUND() Functions**: The `AVG` function calculates the average of the `experience_years` for each project, and the `ROUND` function rounds this average to 2 decimal places.
- **Result**: The output includes the `project_id` and the `average_years` of experience for each project, providing a clear summary of the average experience levels as requested.

This approach efficiently combines the necessary data from both tables, aggregates it appropriately, and computes the required averages, offering a straightforward solution to the problem.
