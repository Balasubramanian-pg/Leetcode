**Description**

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) toProduct table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.
```

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.
```

Write a solution that reports the total quantity sold for every product id.

Return the resulting table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------------+----------------+
| product_id   | total_quantity |
+--------------+----------------+
| 100          | 22             |
| 200          | 15             |
+--------------+----------------+
```

**Solutions**

# SQL Problem: Total Quantity Sold by Product

Let me solve this problem step by step while explaining my thought process.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Identify the requirements and expected output.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to compute the total quantity sold for each product ID. We have two tables:  

- Sales: Contains transaction records with product_id, quantity, and other fields
- Product: Contains product information like product_name

The expected output is a table with product_id and the sum of quantities sold. The problem states we can return results in any order, which simplifies things.

Looking at the example, I can see that for product_id 100, there were two sales with quantities 10 and 12, resulting in a total_quantity of 22. For product_id 200, there was one sale with quantity 15.

### 2. Determining the Required Data

**Procedural step:** Identify which columns and tables we need.

**My thought process:**  
To calculate the total quantity sold per product, I need:  

- product_id from the Sales table
- quantity from the Sales table

Interestingly, although the Product table is provided, it doesn't seem necessary for this specific query since we're only reporting product_id, not product_name. This makes the solution simpler.

### 3. Planning the Aggregation

**Procedural step:** Determine how to aggregate the data.

**My thought process:**  
This is a straightforward aggregation problem:  

1. Group the Sales data by product_id
2. Sum the quantity for each group

The SQL aggregate function SUM() will handle this operation.

### 4. Drafting the Basic Solution

**Procedural step:** Write the initial query.

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
```

**My thought process:**  
This query:  

- Selects the product_id column
- Calculates the sum of quantities for each product_id
- Aliases the sum as total_quantity as required
- Groups the results by product_id

This simple approach is sufficient because:

- We're only concerned with products that have sales
- We don't need to include product names
- No ordering is specified

### 5. Considering Edge Cases

**Procedural step:** Think about potential edge cases.

**My thought process:**  
Let me consider some edge cases:  

1. **Products with no sales**: The current query will only include products that appear in the Sales table. Products in the Product table with no sales won't appear in our results. The problem doesn't specify whether we should include these, but given the example output doesn't include product_id 300 (which has no sales), I believe our current approach is correct.
2. **NULL quantities**: If there are NULL values in the quantity column, SUM() will ignore them. This is appropriate behavior for this problem.
3. **Duplicate records**: The primary key is (sale_id, year), so there shouldn't be any exact duplicate records. If there were, our query would still correctly sum the quantities.

### 6. Optimizing the Solution

**Procedural step:** Consider performance optimizations.

**My thought process:**  
The query is already quite simple and efficient. It uses a GROUP BY operation which should be fast if there's an index on product_id (which is likely since it's a foreign key).  

One minor optimization is to use positional references in the GROUP BY clause:

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    1;
```

This is slightly more concise but has the same execution plan. It's a matter of style preference.

### 7. Validating with Example Data

**Procedural step:** Verify the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution:  

For the Sales table:

- product_id 100: quantities 10 + 12 = 22
- product_id 200: quantity 15
- product_id 300: not in Sales table, so not in result

Our query should produce:

- (100, 22)
- (200, 15)

This matches the expected output.

### 8. Considering Alternative Approaches

**Procedural step:** Explore other ways to solve the problem.

**My thought process:**  
We could also solve this by joining with the Product table, even though it's not necessary:  

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    COALESCE(SUM(s.quantity), 0) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Product p
LEFT JOIN
    Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY
    p.product_id;
```

This approach would include products with no sales (with a total_quantity of 0). However, since the example output doesn't include product_id 300, I believe the original solution is what's expected.

Another approach could use a subquery:

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    (SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM Sales s2 WHERE s2.product_id = s1.product_id) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Sales s1
GROUP BY
    product_id;
```

But this is less efficient than the straightforward aggregation we used.

## Final Solution

After considering all aspects, the most efficient solution is:

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    product_id;
```

This query:

1. Groups sales records by product_id
2. Calculates the total quantity sold for each product
3. Returns only products that have sales, as shown in the example
4. Is efficient and straightforward

The query doesn't need any special handling for edge cases and directly addresses the problem statement. While we could join with the Product table to get product names or to include products with no sales, the problem doesn't require that information in the output.
