Table: `Salary`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
The sex column is ENUM (category) value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
```

Write a solution to swap all `'f'` and `'m'` values (i.e., change all `'f'` values to `'m'` and vice versa) with a **single update statement** and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, **do not** write any select statement for this problem.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Salary table:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | m   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | f   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | m   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | f   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Output:
+----+------+-----+--------+
| id | name | sex | salary |
+----+------+-----+--------+
| 1  | A    | f   | 2500   |
| 2  | B    | m   | 1500   |
| 3  | C    | f   | 5500   |
| 4  | D    | m   | 500    |
+----+------+-----+--------+
Explanation:
(1, A) and (3, C) were changed from 'm' to 'f'.
(2, B) and (4, D) were changed from 'f' to 'm'.
```

# Swapping Gender Values in Salary Table

To solve this problem, I need to update all 'f' values to 'm' and all 'm' values to 'f' in the sex column of the Salary table with a single UPDATE statement, without using temporary tables.

## Approach

1. **Single UPDATE Statement**: Use a CASE expression to swap the values
2. **Conditional Logic**:
    - When sex is 'f', set it to 'm'
    - When sex is 'm', set it to 'f'
3. **Update All Rows**: Apply this change to all rows in the table

## Solution Code

```SQL
UPDATE Salary
SET sex = CASE
            WHEN sex = 'f' THEN 'm'
            WHEN sex = 'm' THEN 'f'
          END;
```

## Explanation

- The UPDATE statement modifies the Salary table directly
- The CASE expression checks each row's sex value:
    - If it's 'f', changes it to 'm'
    - If it's 'm', changes it to 'f'
- This handles all possible cases since sex is an ENUM of only 'm' and 'f'
- After execution:
    - All original 'm' values become 'f'
    - All original 'f' values become 'm'
- The example shows exactly this transformation being applied to all rows

This solution efficiently performs the required value swap in a single SQL statement without needing temporary tables or multiple queries.
