Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
```

Write a solution to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is `100%` of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee's name does not start with the character** `'M'`. The bonus of an employee is `0` otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
Explanation:
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.
```

# Calculating Employee Bonuses

To solve this problem, I need to calculate bonuses for employees based on two conditions:

1. The employee ID must be odd
2. The employee's name must not start with 'M'  
    If both conditions are met, the bonus equals the salary; otherwise, it's 0.  
    

## Approach

1. **Check Conditions**: Use a CASE statement to evaluate both criteria
2. **Calculate Bonus**: Assign full salary if conditions are met, 0 otherwise
3. **Order Results**: Sort by employee_id as required

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    employee_id,
    CASE
        WHEN employee_id % 2 = 1 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
        ELSE 0
    END AS bonus
FROM
    Employees
ORDER BY
    employee_id;
```

## Explanation

1. The CASE statement checks:
    - `employee_id % 2 = 1` tests for odd employee IDs
    - `name NOT LIKE 'M%'` ensures names don't start with 'M'
2. When both conditions are true, the bonus equals the salary
3. Otherwise, the bonus is 0
4. Results are ordered by employee_id
5. In the example:
    - Employee 2: even ID → 0 bonus
    - Employee 3: odd ID but name starts with 'M' → 0 bonus
    - Employee 7: odd ID, name doesn't start with 'M' → 7400 bonus
    - Employee 8: even ID → 0 bonus
    - Employee 9: odd ID, name doesn't start with 'M' → 7700 bonus

This solution efficiently calculates bonuses using conditional logic and presents the results in the required order.
