**Description**

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| sale_id      | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| sale_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
sale_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold.
```

Since table Sales was filled manually in the year `2000`, `product_name` may contain leading and/or trailing white spaces, also they are case-insensitive.

Write a solution to report

- `product_name` in lowercase without leading or trailing white spaces.
- `sale_date` in the format `('YYYY-MM')`.
- `total` the number of times the product was sold in this month.

Return the result table ordered by `product_name` in **ascending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `sale_date` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+--------------+------------+
| sale_id | product_name | sale_date  |
+---------+--------------+------------+
| 1       | LCPHONE      | 2000-01-16 |
| 2       | LCPhone      | 2000-01-17 |
| 3       | LcPhOnE      | 2000-02-18 |
| 4       | LCKeyCHAiN   | 2000-02-19 |
| 5       | LCKeyChain   | 2000-02-28 |
| 6       | Matryoshka   | 2000-03-31 |
+---------+--------------+------------+
Output:
+--------------+-----------+-------+
| product_name | sale_date | total |
+--------------+-----------+-------+
| lckeychain   | 2000-02   | 2     |
| lcphone      | 2000-01   | 2     |
| lcphone      | 2000-02   | 1     |
| matryoshka   | 2000-03   | 1     |
+--------------+-----------+-------+
Explanation:
In January, 2 LcPhones were sold. Please note that the product names are not case sensitive and may contain spaces.
In February, 2 LCKeychains and 1 LCPhone were sold.
In March, one matryoshka was sold.
```

For this SQL problem, we need to clean up the product names, format the sale dates, and count the total sales per product per month. Let's break down the solution:

```SQL
WITH
    CleanedSales AS (
        SELECT
            LOWER(TRIM(product_name)) AS product_name,
            DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_date
        FROM Sales
    )
SELECT
    product_name,
    sale_date,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM CleanedSales
GROUP BY product_name, sale_date
ORDER BY product_name, sale_date;
```

Let me explain this solution step by step:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**:
    - The `CleanedSales` CTE transforms the raw data:
        - `LOWER(TRIM(product_name))` makes product names lowercase and removes leading/trailing spaces
        - `DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m')` formats dates to 'YYYY-MM' format
2. **Aggregation**:
    - The main query groups by the cleaned product name and formatted sale date
    - `COUNT(*)` (or `COUNT(1)` in the original solution) counts occurrences in each group
3. **Sorting**:
    - The results are ordered by product_name (ascending)
    - In case of ties, they're ordered by sale_date (ascending)

**Example Workflow:**

- "LCPHONE" (2000-01-16) → "lcphone" (2000-01)
- "LCPhone" (2000-01-17) → "lcphone" (2000-01)
- "LcPhOnE" (2000-02-18) → "lcphone" (2000-02)
- "LCKeyCHAiN" (2000-02-19) → "lckeychain" (2000-02)
- "LCKeyChain" (2000-02-28) → "lckeychain" (2000-02)
- "Matryoshka" (2000-03-31) → "matryoshka" (2000-03)

After grouping and counting, we get the expected output. The query efficiently handles the case-insensitivity and whitespace issues while formatting the date as required.

Note: `GROUP BY 1, 2` in the original solution is shorthand for `GROUP BY product_name, sale_date` - both approaches work the same.
