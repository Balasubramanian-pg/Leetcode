**Description**

Table: `Steps`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| steps_count | int  |
| steps_date  | date |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, steps_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, steps_count, and steps_date.
```

Write a solution to calculate `3-day` **rolling averages** of steps for each user.

We calculate the `n-day` **rolling average** this way:

- For each day, we calculate the average of `n` consecutive days of step counts ending on that day if available, otherwise, `n-day` rolling average is not defined for it.

Output the `user_id`, `steps_date`, and rolling average. Round the rolling average to **two decimal places**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id`_,_ `steps_date` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-06 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (395 + 499 + 712) / 3 = 535.33.
- For user id 1, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-07 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (499 + 712 + 576) / 3 = 595.67.
- For user id 2, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-08 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (153 + 171 + 530) / 3 = 284.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-09 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (120 + 557 + 840) / 3 = 505.67.
- For user id 3, the step counts for the three consecutive days up to 2021-09-10 are available. Consequently, the rolling average for this particular date is computed as (557 + 840 + 627) / 3 = 674.67.
- For user id 4 and 5, the calculation of the rolling average is not viable as there is insufficient data for the consecutive three days. Output table ordered by user_id and steps_date in ascending order.
```

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to calculate a 3-day rolling average of step counts for each user. This average for a specific date should include the steps for that date and the two days _immediately before_ it.

A crucial point is that the rolling average is _only valid_ if steps for all three consecutive days (the current day and the two preceding days) exist. We need to output the user ID, the date, and the calculated rolling average, rounded to two decimal places, and ordered by user ID and date.

We'll be working with the `Steps` table. To calculate values based on a window of rows, we will use window functions.

Step 1: We need to process the step counts for each user separately and in date order. For each row (representing a user's steps on a specific date), we want to look at the current row and the two rows that come before it for the same user, ordered by date.

```SQL
-- We will use a CTE to perform window calculations.
WITH RollingCalculations AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        steps_date,
        steps_count
        -- Window functions will go here
    FROM Steps
    -- It's helpful to order early for clarity, though the window function OVER clause is what matters for calculation order.
    ORDER BY user_id, steps_date
)
-- This first step sets up a temporary view of the data, ordered by user and date.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `RollingCalculations`. We select the relevant columns from the `Steps` table and order them by `user_id` and `steps_date`. This ordering isn't strictly necessary _for the window function's logic_ (that's handled by the `ORDER BY` within `OVER()`), but it makes the intermediate CTE results easier to understand.

Step 2: Now, within the `RollingCalculations` CTE, we will use window functions to calculate two things for each row: the sum of steps over the 3-day window ending on that date, and the count of rows within that same window. The window is defined as the current row and the two preceding rows, partitioned by user.

```SQL
WITH RollingCalculations AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        steps_date,
        steps_count,
        -- Calculate the sum of steps over the current row and the 2 preceding rows for the same user
        SUM(steps_count) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY steps_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS sum_steps_3_days,
        -- Count the number of rows in the same window
        COUNT(steps_count) OVER ( -- Or COUNT(*) here, as steps_count is non-null
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY steps_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS count_days_in_window
    FROM Steps
    -- Ordering the base data is good practice, but the window frame is defined by OVER clause
    -- ORDER BY user_id, steps_date -- Removed here to focus on the CTE output only
)
-- This CTE calculates the sum and count of steps within the 3-day rolling window for each transaction date.
```

Explanation: We add two columns to the `RollingCalculations` CTE using window functions:

- `SUM(steps_count) OVER (...)`: This calculates the sum of `steps_count`.
- `COUNT(steps_count) OVER (...)`: This counts the number of rows (non-null `steps_count`s) within the window.  
    The  
    `OVER` clause defines the window:
    - `PARTITION BY user_id`: The window calculation is done independently for each unique `user_id`.
    - `ORDER BY steps_date`: Within each partition, the rows are ordered by date.
    - `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: This is the window _frame_. It specifies that for the current row (`CURRENT ROW`), the window includes that row and the 2 rows immediately before it (`2 PRECEDING`) within the ordered partition.

Step 3: We need to filter the results. The problem states the rolling average is only defined if steps for all three consecutive days are available. In our window of "current day + 2 preceding days", this means the window must contain exactly 3 rows. We'll select from the CTE created in Step 2 and filter where `count_days_in_window` is exactly 3.

```SQL
WITH RollingCalculations AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FilteredResults AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        steps_date,
        sum_steps_3_days,
        count_days_in_window -- Keep for illustration
    FROM RollingCalculations
    WHERE count_days_in_window = 3 -- Only keep rows where the 3-day window was complete
)
-- This CTE filters out dates where a full 3 days of preceding data are not available (i.e., the first two dates for each user).
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `FilteredResults`. We select the necessary columns from `RollingCalculations` but add a `WHERE` clause: `WHERE count_days_in_window = 3`. This ensures that only those rows where the rolling window actually contained three data points are included.

Step 4: Now that we have only the valid 3-day windows, we can calculate the rolling average by dividing the `sum_steps_3_days` by `count_days_in_window` (which we know is 3). We also need to round this result to two decimal places.

```SQL
WITH RollingCalculations AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FilteredResults AS ( ... ) -- from step 3
SELECT
    user_id,
    steps_date,
    -- Calculate the average and round it to 2 decimal places
    ROUND(CAST(sum_steps_3_days AS DECIMAL) / count_days_in_window, 2) AS rolling_average
FROM FilteredResults;
-- This calculates the final rolling average for the filtered dates, rounded as required.
```

Explanation: We select from the `FilteredResults` CTE. We calculate the average by dividing `sum_steps_3_days` by `count_days_in_window`. We cast `sum_steps_3_days` to `DECIMAL` (or similar floating-point type depending on SQL dialect, e.g., `FLOAT`) before dividing to ensure decimal division. `ROUND(..., 2)` rounds the result to two decimal places. The column is named `rolling_average`.

Step 5: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `user_id` and `steps_date` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH RollingCalculations AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FilteredResults AS ( ... ) -- from step 3
SELECT
    user_id,
    steps_date,
    ROUND(CAST(sum_steps_3_days AS DECIMAL) / count_days_in_window, 2) AS rolling_average
FROM FilteredResults
ORDER BY user_id ASC, steps_date ASC; -- Order the final output
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY user_id ASC, steps_date ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final result set first by `user_id` and then by `steps_date`, both in ascending order.

This query correctly calculates the 3-day rolling average only for dates where a full 3-day window is available, rounds the result, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RollingCalculations AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        steps_date,
        steps_count,
        SUM(steps_count) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY steps_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS sum_steps_3_days,
        COUNT(steps_count) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY steps_date
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS count_days_in_window
    FROM Steps
),
FilteredResults AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        steps_date,
        sum_steps_3_days,
        count_days_in_window
    FROM RollingCalculations
    WHERE count_days_in_window = 3
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    steps_date,
    ROUND(CAST(sum_steps_3_days AS DECIMAL) / count_days_in_window, 2) AS rolling_average
FROM FilteredResults
ORDER BY user_id ASC, steps_date ASC;
```
