**Description**

Table: `Delivery`

```Plain
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called **immediate;** otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 5           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-11                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-26                  |
| 5           | 4           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
Output:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
Explanation: The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.
```

# SQL Query Explanation: Calculating Immediate Delivery Percentage

This SQL query calculates the percentage of immediate orders (where the order date equals the customer's preferred delivery date) from the Delivery table.

## The Problem

We need to:

1. Determine which orders are "immediate" (order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
2. Calculate what percentage of all orders are immediate
3. Round the result to 2 decimal places

## The Solution Explained

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) / COUNT(1) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```

Let's break down this elegant solution step by step:

### 1. Identifying Immediate Orders

```SQL
order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date
```

This comparison returns 1 (TRUE) when the dates match, and 0 (FALSE) when they don't. In MySQL, boolean expressions evaluate to 1 or 0 when used in a numeric context.

### 2. Counting Immediate Orders

```SQL
SUM(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
```

The SUM function adds up all the 1s and 0s from our comparison. This effectively counts how many orders are immediate.

### 3. Calculating Total Orders

```SQL
COUNT(1)
```

This counts the total number of rows in the table. Using COUNT(1) is a common practice that's equivalent to COUNT(*).

### 4. Computing the Percentage

```SQL
SUM(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) / COUNT(1) * 100
```

This divides the number of immediate orders by the total number of orders and multiplies by 100 to get a percentage.

### 5. Rounding to 2 Decimal Places

```SQL
ROUND(..., 2)
```

The ROUND function formats our result to have exactly 2 decimal places.

## Alternative Approaches

We could also write this using a more verbose approach:

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Delivery WHERE order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) /
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Delivery) * 100,
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage;
```

Or using COUNT with a CASE expression:

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 END) /
        COUNT(*) * 100,
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery;
```

However, the original solution is more elegant and efficient because it:

- Uses a single scan of the table
- Leverages the fact that boolean expressions evaluate to 1/0 in numeric contexts
- Is concise and readable

This type of pattern (using SUM of a boolean condition divided by COUNT) is a powerful technique for calculating percentages of rows that meet specific criteria in SQL.
