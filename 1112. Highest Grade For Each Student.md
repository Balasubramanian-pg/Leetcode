**Description**

Table: `Enrollments`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
grade is never NULL.
```

Write a solution to find the highest grade with its  
corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find  
the course with the smallest  
`course_id`.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
Output:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

**Solutions**

# Finding the Highest Grade Per Student

I'll walk you through multiple approaches to solve this problem, exploring the reasoning, performance considerations, and edge cases for each method.

## Problem Analysis: Breaking Down the Requirements

We need to:

1. Find the highest grade for each student
2. If two courses have the same (highest) grade, select the one with the lower course_id
3. Return student_id, course_id, and grade ordered by student_id

This is essentially a "group by with top N per group" problem, which is a common SQL pattern with several solution strategies.

## Solution Strategy #1: Window Functions with RANK()

Window functions are perfect for this type of problem. Let's break down how it works:

```SQL
WITH RankedGrades AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        course_id,
        grade,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY student_id
            ORDER BY grade DESC, course_id ASC
        ) AS grade_rank
    FROM Enrollments
)
SELECT student_id, course_id, grade
FROM RankedGrades
WHERE grade_rank = 1
ORDER BY student_id;
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Partitioning the Data**: `PARTITION BY student_id` creates separate windows for each student
2. **Ranking Within Partitions**: `ORDER BY grade DESC, course_id ASC` ranks by:
    - Highest grade first
    - If grades tie, lowest course_id first
3. **Filtering Top Ranks**: `WHERE grade_rank = 1` keeps only the rows with rank 1
4. **Final Ordering**: `ORDER BY student_id` sorts the result as required

### Execution Flow Visualization:

For our example data, here's what happens internally:

**Initial Data**:

```Plain
+------------+-----------+-------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

**After Applying RANK()**:

```Plain
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade | grade_rank |
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+
| 1          | 1         | 90    | 2          |
| 1          | 2         | 99    | 1          | ← Selected (highest grade)
| 2          | 2         | 95    | 1          | ← Selected (tie with lowest course_id)
| 2          | 3         | 95    | 2          |
| 3          | 1         | 80    | 2          |
| 3          | 2         | 75    | 3          |
| 3          | 3         | 82    | 1          | ← Selected (highest grade)
+------------+-----------+-------+------------+
```

**Final Result**:

```Plain
+------------+-----------+-------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
```

### Deep Dive into RANK():

RANK() assigns the same rank to ties, then skips the next rank(s). For example, if two rows tie for rank 1, the next row gets rank 3. In contrast:

- DENSE_RANK() would give the next row rank 2 (no gaps)
- ROW_NUMBER() would assign unique ranks even for ties (based on physical order)

For our problem, RANK() is appropriate because:

1. We want to select ALL rows with the highest grade (ties included)
2. Our subsequent filtering (WHERE grade_rank = 1) works correctly with any of these functions since we only care about rank 1

### Performance Characteristics:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting within partitions
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the temporary result set
- **Strengths**:
    - Single table scan
    - Clear, expressive syntax
    - Well-optimized in modern databases
- **Weaknesses**:
    - Memory-intensive for very large datasets
    - Not available in older database versions

## Solution Strategy #2: Subquery with IN Clause

This approach uses two levels of grouping:

```SQL
SELECT student_id, MIN(course_id) AS course_id, grade
FROM Enrollments
WHERE (student_id, grade) IN (
    SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) AS grade
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
)
GROUP BY student_id, grade
ORDER BY student_id;
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Inner Subquery**: Find highest grade per student
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) AS grade
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
    ```
    
    Result:
    
    ```Plain
    +------------+-------+
    | student_id | grade |
    +------------+-------+
    | 1          | 99    |
    | 2          | 95    |
    | 3          | 82    |
    +------------+-------+
    ```
    
2. **Outer Query**: Find the minimum course_id for each (student_id, grade) pair from #1
    - Filter using WHERE clause to keep only rows with the max grade
    - Group again to find MIN(course_id) for tied grades
    - Order the final result

### Why This Works:

The key insight is using a composite key in the IN clause. (student_id, grade) creates a tuple match condition that filters the rows to only those with the max grade for each student.

### Query Processing Details:

1. Database first executes the subquery to get max grades per student
2. Then filters the main table using the composite key match
3. Performs another grouping to find lowest course_id (for tied grades)
4. Finally sorts by student_id

### Performance Considerations:

- **Execution Plan**: Typically involves:
    - Full table scan for subquery
    - Hash match or nested loop join
    - Hash aggregation for grouping
    - Sort operation
- **Optimization Tips**:
    - Ensure indexes on (student_id, grade, course_id)
    - Consider materialization of the subquery for large datasets
- **Strengths**:
    - Works in older database versions without window functions
    - Sometimes more efficient with the right indexes
- **Weaknesses**:
    - More complex logic
    - Potential for multiple table scans
    - More challenging to optimize

## Solution Strategy #3: JOIN with Aggregation

Another approach uses a self-join to match the highest grades:

```SQL
SELECT e.student_id, MIN(e.course_id) AS course_id, e.grade
FROM Enrollments e
JOIN (
    SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) AS max_grade
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
) max_grades
ON e.student_id = max_grades.student_id AND e.grade = max_grades.max_grade
GROUP BY e.student_id, e.grade
ORDER BY e.student_id;
```

### How This Works:

1. The derived table (subquery) finds the highest grade for each student
2. The join matches original rows with these maximum grades
3. The outer query finds the minimum course_id among tied grades

### Query Execution Flow:

1. Calculate max grades per student
2. Join back to original table
3. Group again to handle ties
4. Sort the final result

### When To Prefer This Approach:

- When the database optimizer handles joins better than IN clauses
- When you need additional filtering or calculations that are easier with joins
- When you want to include additional columns from the original table

## Solution Strategy #4: Correlated Subquery with NOT EXISTS

A different approach using anti-join logic:

```SQL
SELECT e1.student_id, e1.course_id, e1.grade
FROM Enrollments e1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Enrollments e2
    WHERE e2.student_id = e1.student_id AND
          (e2.grade > e1.grade OR
           (e2.grade = e1.grade AND e2.course_id < e1.course_id))
)
ORDER BY e1.student_id;
```

### Logic Explanation:

This query finds rows where there doesn't exist any other row for the same student with:

1. A higher grade OR
2. The same grade but lower course_id

In other words, it selects rows where there's no "better" option according to our criteria.

### Performance Analysis:

- **Execution Pattern**: For each row, runs a correlated subquery
- **Time Complexity**: Potentially O(n²) in worst case
- **Optimization**: Can be very efficient with proper indexes
- **Index Recommendation**: (student_id, grade DESC, course_id ASC)

While often considered inefficient, modern query optimizers can transform this to a more efficient plan similar to other approaches.

## Solution Strategy #5: CTE Chain with MAX and ROW_NUMBER()

For databases supporting CTEs, a step-by-step approach offers clarity:

```SQL
WITH MaxGrades AS (
    -- Step 1: Find maximum grade for each student
    SELECT student_id, MAX(grade) AS max_grade
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
),
EligibleCourses AS (
    -- Step 2: Get all courses that match the max grade for each student
    SELECT e.student_id, e.course_id, e.grade,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY e.student_id
                            ORDER BY e.course_id) AS row_num
    FROM Enrollments e
    JOIN MaxGrades m ON e.student_id = m.student_id AND e.grade = m.max_grade
)
-- Step 3: Select the course with lowest ID for each student
SELECT student_id, course_id, grade
FROM EligibleCourses
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY student_id;
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **MaxGrades CTE**: Calculate highest grade per student
2. **EligibleCourses CTE**:
    - Join to get all courses with max grade
    - Assign row numbers ordered by course_id
3. **Final query**: Keep only the first row (lowest course_id) for each student

### Advantages of CTE Chain:

1. **Readability**: Makes complex logic clear and sequential
2. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify individual steps
3. **Debugging**: Can test each CTE separately during development
4. **Self-documenting**: Steps clearly labeled with comments

## Database Engine Performance Considerations

Different databases optimize these queries differently:

### MySQL Specific:

- Prior to MySQL 8.0, window functions weren't available
- With MySQL 8.0+, RANK() approach is typically most efficient
- For older versions, the JOIN approach often performs best

### PostgreSQL:

- Excellent window function optimization
- Often transforms different query styles to similar execution plans
- Materialized CTEs can help with large datasets

### SQL Server:

- TOP WITH TIES can be used as an alternative approach
- Query hints may help optimize specific approaches

## Edge Cases and Subtleties

Consider these scenarios:

1. **Multiple Tied Courses**: The original data may have:
    
    ```Plain
    +------------+-----------+-------+
    | student_id | course_id | grade |
    +------------+-----------+-------+
    | 4          | 1         | 100   |
    | 4          | 2         | 100   |
    | 4          | 3         | 100   |
    +------------+-----------+-------+
    ```
    
    All solutions correctly return (4, 1, 100) due to MIN(course_id) or ORDER BY course_id.
    
2. **Empty Table**: All solutions return an empty result set correctly.
3. **Single Course Per Student**: Trivially handled by all approaches.
4. **Very Large Course ID Range**: No impact on correctness, but potentially on performance.

## Index Optimization

For optimal performance, consider these indexes:

1. **Composite Index**: (student_id, grade DESC, course_id ASC)
    - Supports sorting, filtering, and joining operations
    - Covers the entire query for index-only scans
2. **Fall-back Indexes**:
    - (student_id, grade) for the subquery approach
    - (student_id) for initial grouping

## Performance Comparison

When dealing with large datasets:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Approach|Small Dataset|Medium Dataset|Large Dataset|
|RANK()|Excellent|Excellent|Good|
|IN Subquery|Good|Good|Fair|
|JOIN|Good|Good|Good|
|NOT EXISTS|Fair|Poor|Poor|
|CTE Chain|Excellent|Excellent|Good|

## Final Recommendation: RANK() Approach

For modern databases, the RANK() window function approach is generally the best choice because:

1. **Clarity**: The intent is immediately clear from the query structure
2. **Performance**: Single table scan with efficient sorting
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify or extend the ranking criteria
4. **Standard Approach**: Widely recognized pattern for "top N per group" problems

```SQL
WITH RankedGrades AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        course_id,
        grade,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY student_id
            ORDER BY grade DESC, course_id ASC
        ) AS grade_rank
    FROM Enrollments
)
SELECT student_id, course_id, grade
FROM RankedGrades
WHERE grade_rank = 1
ORDER BY student_id;
```

This solution elegantly captures the essence of the problem: ranking each student's courses by grade (descending) and course_id (ascending), then keeping only the top-ranked course for each student.

## Procedural Thought Process for Future Problems

When facing similar "top N per group" problems, follow this mental model:

1. **Identify the grouping key**: What defines each group? (student_id)
2. **Determine ranking criteria**: What orders items within groups? (grade DESC, course_id ASC)
3. **Choose selection method**: Do you need top 1, top N, or filtered results?
4. **Evaluate available SQL features**: Window functions vs. traditional SQL approaches
5. **Consider performance factors**: Dataset size, indexes, and database capabilities

This structured approach will help you tackle similar SQL challenges efficiently and confidently.
