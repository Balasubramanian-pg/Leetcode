**Description**

Table: `Customer`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the information of each customer in the WebStore.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| sale_date     | date    |
| order_cost    | int     |
| customer_id   | int     |
| seller_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains all orders made in the webstore.
sale_date is the date when the transaction was made between the customer (customer_id) and the seller (seller_id).
```

Table: `Seller`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| seller_id     | int     |
| seller_name   | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
seller_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the information of each seller.
```

Write a solution to report the names of all sellers who did not make any sales in `2020`.

Return the result table ordered by `seller_name` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customer table:
+--------------+---------------+
| customer_id  | customer_name |
+--------------+---------------+
| 101          | Alice         |
| 102          | Bob           |
| 103          | Charlie       |
+--------------+---------------+
Orders table:
+-------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| order_id    | sale_date  | order_cost   | customer_id | seller_id   |
+-------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 2020-03-01 | 1500         | 101         | 1           |
| 2           | 2020-05-25 | 2400         | 102         | 2           |
| 3           | 2019-05-25 | 800          | 101         | 3           |
| 4           | 2020-09-13 | 1000         | 103         | 2           |
| 5           | 2019-02-11 | 700          | 101         | 2           |
+-------------+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Seller table:
+-------------+-------------+
| seller_id   | seller_name |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | Daniel      |
| 2           | Elizabeth   |
| 3           | Frank       |
+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| seller_name |
+-------------+
| Frank       |
+-------------+
Explanation:
Daniel made 1 sale in March 2020.
Elizabeth made 2 sales in 2020 and 1 sale in 2019.
Frank made 1 sale in 2019 but no sales in 2020.
```

## Solutions

I'll provide multiple solutions for finding sellers who didn't make any sales in 2020.

## Solution 1: Using NOT IN

```SQL
SELECT seller_name
FROM Seller
WHERE seller_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT seller_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
)
ORDER BY seller_name;
```

This solution uses a subquery to find all seller IDs that made sales in 2020, then uses `NOT IN` to find sellers who aren't in that list.

## Solution 2: Using LEFT JOIN with NULL Check

```SQL
SELECT s.seller_name
FROM Seller s
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT DISTINCT seller_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31'
) o ON s.seller_id = o.seller_id
WHERE o.seller_id IS NULL
ORDER BY s.seller_name;
```

This solution uses a LEFT JOIN between the Seller table and a subquery of 2020 sales. The NULL check finds sellers without any matching 2020 sales.

## Solution 3: Using NOT EXISTS

```SQL
SELECT seller_name
FROM Seller s
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    WHERE o.seller_id = s.seller_id
    AND YEAR(sale_date) = 2020
)
ORDER BY seller_name;
```

This solution uses a correlated subquery with NOT EXISTS to find sellers for whom there are no orders in 2020.

## Solution 4: Using COUNT and HAVING

```SQL
SELECT s.seller_name
FROM Seller s
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON s.seller_id = o.seller_id AND YEAR(o.sale_date) = 2020
GROUP BY s.seller_id, s.seller_name
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) = 0
ORDER BY s.seller_name;
```

This solution groups by seller and counts the number of 2020 orders, then filters for those with zero orders.

## Solution 5: Using EXCEPT (or MINUS in some databases)

```SQL
SELECT seller_name
FROM Seller
WHERE seller_id IN (
    SELECT seller_id FROM Seller
    EXCEPT
    SELECT seller_id FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2020
)
ORDER BY seller_name;
```

This solution uses set operations to find seller IDs that exist in the Seller table but not in the 2020 Orders.

Each of these solutions will produce the same result, identifying "Frank" as the only seller without sales in 2020. The choice between them might depend on your database system and performance considerations for your specific data volumes.
