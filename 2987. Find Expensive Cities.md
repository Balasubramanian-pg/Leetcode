**Description**

Table: `Listings`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| listing_id  | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
listing_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains listing_id, city, and price.
```

Write a solution to find **cities** where the **average home prices** exceed the **national** average home price.

Return _the result table sorted by_ `city` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Listings table:
+------------+--------------+---------+
| listing_id | city         | price   |
+------------+--------------+---------+
| 113        | LosAngeles   | 7560386 |
| 136        | SanFrancisco | 2380268 |

| 121        | NewYork      | 2893760 |
+------------+--------------+---------+
Output
+------------+
| city       |
+------------+
| Chicago    |
| LosAngeles |
+------------+
Explanation
The national average home price is $6,122,059.45. Among the cities listed:
- Chicago has an average price of $7,048,706.75
- Los Angeles has an average price of $6,277,754.5
- San Francisco has an average price of $3,900,513.33
- New York has an average price of $4,422,739
Only Chicago and Los Angeles have average home prices exceeding the national average. Therefore, these two cities are included in the output table. The output table is sorted in ascending order based on the city names.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find cities where the average listing price is higher than the average listing price for the entire country (or, in this case, all listings in the table). We need to output the names of these cities, ordered alphabetically.

We will be working with the `Listings` table, specifically the `city` and `price` columns.

Step 1: Calculate the average listing price across _all_ listings in the table. This is the "national average" we'll compare against. We can do this by taking the `AVG()` of the `price` column.

```SQL
SELECT
    AVG(price) AS national_average_price
FROM Listings;
-- This calculates the overall average price of all listings in the table.
```

Explanation: We use the `AVG()` aggregate function on the `price` column from the `Listings` table. Since there is no `GROUP BY` clause, it calculates the average across all rows in the table, giving us the single value representing the national average.

Step 2: Calculate the average listing price _for each city_. We do this by grouping the `Listings` table by `city` and calculating the average `price` within each city group.

```SQL
SELECT
    city,
    AVG(price) AS city_average_price
FROM Listings
GROUP BY city;
-- This calculates the average price for each individual city.
```

Explanation: We group the rows from the `Listings` table by the `city` column. For each unique city, `AVG(price)` calculates the average price of all listings in that specific city.

Step 3: Now we need to compare the `city_average_price` from Step 2 with the `national_average_price` from Step 1. We only want to keep the cities where the city average is greater than the national average. We can achieve this by using the result of Step 1 (the national average) as a value to filter the results of Step 2 (the city averages).

```SQL
WITH CityAverages AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        AVG(price) AS city_average_price
    FROM Listings
    GROUP BY city
),
NationalAverage AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(price) AS national_average_price
    FROM Listings
)
SELECT
    ca.city
FROM CityAverages ca
-- Compare each city's average to the national average
WHERE ca.city_average_price > (SELECT national_average_price FROM NationalAverage);
-- This combines the city averages and the national average, and filters to keep only cities where the city average is higher.
```

Explanation: We create two CTEs: `CityAverages` (from Step 2) and `NationalAverage` (from Step 1). We then select the `city` from `CityAverages` (aliased `ca`). The `WHERE` clause uses a subquery `(SELECT national_average_price FROM NationalAverage)` to get the single national average value and compares `ca.city_average_price` to it. Only cities where the city average is strictly greater than the national average are included.

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the result table to be ordered by `city` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH CityAverages AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        AVG(price) AS city_average_price
    FROM Listings
    GROUP BY city
),
NationalAverage AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(price) AS national_average_price
    FROM Listings
)
SELECT
    ca.city
FROM CityAverages ca
WHERE ca.city_average_price > (SELECT national_average_price FROM NationalAverage)
ORDER BY ca.city ASC; -- Order the final output by city name
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY ca.city ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final list of cities alphabetically.

This query successfully calculates both the city-level and national-level averages, performs the necessary comparison, and presents the qualifying cities in the required order.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH CityAverages AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        AVG(price) AS city_average_price
    FROM Listings
    GROUP BY city
),
NationalAverage AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(price) AS national_average_price
    FROM Listings
)
SELECT
    ca.city
FROM CityAverages ca
WHERE ca.city_average_price > (SELECT national_average_price FROM NationalAverage)
ORDER BY ca.city ASC;
```
