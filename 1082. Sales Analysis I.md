**Description**

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
```

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |

| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.

# SQL Problem: Finding the Best Seller by Total Sales Price

Let me solve this problem step by step while explaining my thought process.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Identify what we need to calculate and return.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to find the seller(s) with the highest total sales price. We have:  

- Product table: Contains product information including unit_price
- Sales table: Contains sales transactions with seller_id, product_id, quantity, and price

The key points are:

- We need to calculate the total sales price for each seller
- We need to identify the seller(s) with the maximum total
- If multiple sellers tie for the maximum, we should return all of them
- We only need to return the seller_id column

Interestingly, the Sales table already has a price column, which appears to be the total price for each transaction (quantity × unit_price). We don't need to calculate this ourselves by joining with the Product table.

### 2. Planning the Aggregation

**Procedural step:** Determine how to calculate the total sales for each seller.

**My thought process:**  
To find the total sales price per seller, we need to:  

1. Group the Sales table by seller_id
2. Sum the price column for each group

This will give us the total sales amount for each seller.

```SQL
SELECT
    seller_id,
    SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    seller_id;
```

This would return each seller with their total sales amount. Looking at the example data:

- Seller 1: 2000 + 800 = 2800
- Seller 2: 800
- Seller 3: 2800

### 3. Identifying the Maximum Total

**Procedural step:** Find the seller(s) with the maximum total sales.

**My thought process:**  
Now we need to identify which seller(s) have the maximum total. There are several approaches:  

### Approach 1: Using a Window Function

```SQL
WITH SellerTotals AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        SUM(price) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC) AS sales_rank
    FROM
        Sales
    GROUP BY
        seller_id
)
SELECT
    seller_id
FROM
    SellerTotals
WHERE
    sales_rank = 1;
```

This approach:

1. Calculates the total sales for each seller
2. Ranks sellers by their total sales in descending order
3. Selects only the sellers with rank 1 (those with the maximum total)

I'm using RANK() because it assigns the same rank to ties, which is what we need for this problem.

### Approach 2: Using a Subquery

```SQL
SELECT
    seller_id
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    seller_id
HAVING
    SUM(price) = (
        SELECT
            MAX(total_sales)
        FROM (
            SELECT
                seller_id,
                SUM(price) AS total_sales
            FROM
                Sales
            GROUP BY
                seller_id
        ) AS seller_totals
    );
```

This approach:

1. Groups by seller_id and calculates the sum of price
2. Uses a subquery to find the maximum total sales across all sellers
3. Keeps only the sellers whose total equals this maximum

### Approach 3: Using ALL Operator

```SQL
SELECT
    seller_id
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    seller_id
HAVING
    SUM(price) >= ALL (
        SELECT
            SUM(price)
        FROM
            Sales
        GROUP BY
            seller_id
    );
```

This approach:

1. Groups by seller_id and calculates the sum of price
2. Uses the ALL operator to compare each seller's total with all other totals
3. Keeps only the sellers whose total is greater than or equal to all other totals

### 4. Assessing the Approaches

**Procedural step:** Compare the different solutions and choose the best one.

**My thought process:**  
All three approaches would work correctly for this problem, but they have different characteristics:  

1. **Window Function Approach**:
    - Most modern and readable
    - Explicitly shows the ranking step
    - Generally efficient in modern databases
2. **Subquery Approach**:
    - More traditional SQL
    - Requires a nested subquery
    - Clear separation of finding the maximum and comparing against it
3. **ALL Operator Approach**:
    - Most concise
    - Directly expresses "not less than any other total"
    - May not be optimized well in all database systems

I would prefer the window function approach for its clarity and explicit handling of ties.

### 5. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Validate the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution using the window function approach:  

1. Total sales by seller:
    - Seller 1: 2000 + 800 = 2800
    - Seller 2: 800
    - Seller 3: 2800
2. Ranking by total sales:
    - Seller 1: 2800, rank = 1
    - Seller 2: 800, rank = 3
    - Seller 3: 2800, rank = 1
3. Filtering by rank = 1:
    - Seller 1
    - Seller 3

This matches the expected output, where both sellers 1 and 3 are identified as the best sellers with a total of 2800 each.

### 6. Verifying Edge Cases

**Procedural step:** Consider potential edge cases.

**My thought process:**  
Some edge cases to consider:  

1. **No sales data**: If the Sales table is empty, our query would return an empty result, which is appropriate.
2. **All sellers have the same total**: All would be returned, which is correct.
3. **NULL values**: If price contains NULL values, SUM() would ignore them. If seller_id contains NULL values, they would be grouped separately, which is likely not what we want, but the problem statement implies seller_id is not nullable.

### 7. Optimizing the Solution

**Procedural step:** Consider any performance optimizations.

**My thought process:**  
The query is already quite efficient, but a few considerations:  

1. We're only using the Sales table, not the Product table, which simplifies the query.
2. An index on seller_id would improve the GROUP BY performance.
3. For very large datasets, a two-step approach (first calculate totals, then find the maximum) might be more efficient than the ALL operator approach.

## Final Solution

After considering all approaches, here's my recommended solution using window functions:

```SQL
WITH SellerTotals AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        SUM(price) AS total_sales,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC) AS sales_rank
    FROM
        Sales
    GROUP BY
        seller_id
)
SELECT
    seller_id
FROM
    SellerTotals
WHERE
    sales_rank = 1;
```

This solution:

1. Clearly calculates the total sales for each seller
2. Efficiently ranks sellers based on their total sales
3. Correctly handles ties by using RANK() instead of ROW_NUMBER()
4. Returns only the seller_id column as required
5. Will return all sellers with the maximum total in case of a tie

The window function approach provides the clearest expression of the logic and is well-optimized for performance in modern database systems.
