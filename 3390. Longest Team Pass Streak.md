**Description**

Table: `Teams`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| player_id   | int     |
| team_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
player_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains the unique identifier for player and the name of one of the teams participating in that match.
```

Table: `Passes`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| pass_from   | int     |
| time_stamp  | varchar |
| pass_to     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(pass_from, time_stamp) is the unique key for this table.
pass_from is a foreign key to player_id from Teams table.
Each row represents a pass made during a match, time_stamp represents the time in minutes (00:00-90:00) when the pass was made,
pass_to is the player_id of the player receiving the pass.
```

Write a solution to find the **longest successful pass streak** for **each team** during the match. The rules are as follows:

- A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where:
    - Both the `pass_from` and `pass_to` players belong to the same team
- A streak breaks when either:
    - The pass is intercepted (received by a player from the opposing team)

Return _the result table ordered by_ `team_name` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Teams table:

```Plain
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | team_name |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | Arsenal   |
| 2         | Arsenal   |
| 3         | Arsenal   |
| 4         | Arsenal   |
| 5         | Chelsea   |
| 6         | Chelsea   |
| 7         | Chelsea   |
| 8         | Chelsea   |
+-----------+-----------+
```

Passes table:

```Plain
+-----------+------------+---------+
| pass_from | time_stamp | pass_to |
+-----------+------------+---------+
| 1         | 00:05      | 2       |
| 2         | 00:07      | 3       |
| 3         | 00:08      | 4       |
| 4         | 00:10      | 5       |
| 6         | 00:15      | 7       |
| 7         | 00:17      | 8       |
| 8         | 00:20      | 6       |
| 6         | 00:22      | 5       |
| 1         | 00:25      | 2       |
| 2         | 00:27      | 3       |
+-----------+------------+---------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------+----------------+
| team_name | longest_streak |
+-----------+----------------+
| Arsenal   | 3              |
| Chelsea   | 4              |
+-----------+----------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Arsenal**'s streaks:
    
    ```Plain
    <ul>
    	<li>First streak: 3 passes (1&rarr;2&rarr;3&rarr;4) ended when player 4 passed to Chelsea&#39;s player 5</li>
    	<li>Second streak: 2 passes (1&rarr;2&rarr;3)</li>
    	<li>Longest streak = 3</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chelsea</strong>&#39;s streaks:
    <ul>
    	<li>First streak: 3 passes (6&rarr;7&rarr;8&rarr;6&rarr;5)</li>
    	<li>Longest streak = 4</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    ```
    

## Solutions

<Inner Monologue>  
Let's break down this problem step by step:  

1. We have two tables:
    - `Teams`: Contains player IDs and their team names.
    - `Passes`: Contains pass information, including who made the pass (`pass_from`), when (`time_stamp`), and to whom (`pass_to`).
2. We need to find the longest successful pass streak for each team during the match, where:
    - A successful pass is one where both the passer and receiver belong to the same team.
    - A streak breaks when a pass is intercepted (i.e., received by a player from the opposing team).
3. We need to return the team name and the length of the longest streak, ordered by team name in ascending order.

This is a complex problem that requires tracking consecutive successful passes for each team. Let me think through the approach:

1. First, I need to identify which team each player (both `pass_from` and `pass_to`) belongs to.
2. Then, I need to determine if each pass is successful (same team) or an interception (different teams).
3. Finally, I need to count the longest consecutive successful passes for each team.

For step 3, I'll need to use window functions to help identify streaks of successful passes.

Let's start by joining the `Passes` table with the `Teams` table twice to identify the teams for both the passer and receiver:

```SQL
SELECT
    p.pass_from,
    p.time_stamp,
    p.pass_to,
    t1.team_name AS from_team,
    t2.team_name AS to_team
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
ORDER BY
    p.time_stamp
```

This will give me a list of all passes with their respective teams.

Next, I need to identify successful passes and interceptions. A pass is successful if both players belong to the same team.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.pass_from,
    p.time_stamp,
    p.pass_to,
    t1.team_name AS from_team,
    t2.team_name AS to_team,
    CASE
        WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
        ELSE 0  -- Interception
    END AS is_successful
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
ORDER BY
    p.time_stamp
```

Now, I need to identify streaks of successful passes. This is tricky because we're looking for consecutive successful passes by the same team.

One approach is to use a technique called "gaps and islands" to identify consecutive groups of successful passes by the same team. We can do this by tracking changes in the "is_successful" flag and the "from_team":

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(CASE WHEN is_successful = 0 OR LAG(from_team) OVER (ORDER BY time_stamp) != from_team THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
        OVER (ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
)
SELECT
    from_team,
    streak_group,
    COUNT(*) AS streak_length
FROM
    streak_groups
WHERE
    is_successful = 1
GROUP BY
    from_team, streak_group
ORDER BY
    from_team, streak_group
```

Actually, wait, this is getting overly complex. Let me reconsider the approach.

A streak breaks when a pass is intercepted, so I'm only interested in successful passes for each team. I need to somehow mark streaks of successful passes for each team.

Let me think about this differently. I can create a sequence of pass attempts for each team, and then identify where the successful pass streaks begin and end.

First, let's identify all passing attempts by each team and mark whether they're successful:

```SQL
WITH pass_attempts AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        t1.team_name, p.time_stamp
)
```

Now, I need to identify streaks of successful passes. A streak breaks after an interception (is_successful = 0). I can use a window function to create a group identifier for each streak:

```SQL
WITH pass_attempts AS (
    ... [as above]
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(CASE WHEN LAG(is_successful, 1, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY team_name ORDER BY time_stamp) = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
        OVER (PARTITION BY team_name ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_attempts
)
```

Actually, I think there's still a simpler way to solve this. Let's take a different approach.

For a streak to count, the `pass_to` player of one pass must be the `pass_from` player of the next pass. So for each pass, we can check if the previous pass by the same team ended with the current pass's `pass_from` player.

On second thought, I think I'm overcomplicating this again. Let's go back to the basics.

According to the problem:

- A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where both the `pass_from` and `pass_to` players belong to the same team.
- A streak breaks when the pass is intercepted.

So we're looking for sequences of passes where each pass is successful (same team), and the sequences are broken by interceptions (different teams).

Let's try a different approach using a cumulative sum to identify streaks:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(CASE WHEN from_team != to_team THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
        OVER (ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
)
```

I think I need to rethink this. Let's go back to the problem description and understand what they mean by a "streak":

"A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where both the `pass_from` and `pass_to` players belong to the same team."

This means that for a pass to be part of a streak, both the passer and receiver must be from the same team. Let's call these "successful passes".

"A streak breaks when the pass is intercepted (received by a player from the opposing team)."

This means that if a pass is received by a player from the opposing team (i.e., if `pass_to` belongs to a different team than `pass_from`), then the streak breaks.

So a streak is a sequence of successful passes by a team, broken by an interception.

Let's try a new approach. First, I'll identify all passes and mark whether they're successful:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        t1.team_name, p.time_stamp
)
```

Now, the challenge is to define a way to identify and count streaks. I think the DENSE_RANK window function can help:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    ... [as above]
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Create a new streak group each time a pass is not successful
        SUM(1 - is_successful) OVER (PARTITION BY team_name ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
)
```

The idea behind this approach is to use a running sum of "non-successful" passes to create distinct groups. Each time a pass is not successful (is_successful = 0), the sum increases, creating a new group for the next successful pass.

For the remainder of the query, I can then count the number of successful passes in each streak group and find the maximum for each team:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    ... [as above]
),
streak_groups AS (
    ... [as above]
),
streak_lengths AS (
    SELECT
        team_name,
        streak_group,
        SUM(is_successful) AS streak_length
    FROM
        streak_groups
    GROUP BY
        team_name, streak_group
)
SELECT
    team_name,
    MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM
    streak_lengths
GROUP BY
    team_name
ORDER BY
    team_name
```

Wait, this approach might have issues. Let me trace it with the example data to see if it works correctly.

Using the example data, let's trace it pass by pass:

Arsenal's passes:

1. 1 -> 2: Arsenal to Arsenal, successful
2. 2 -> 3: Arsenal to Arsenal, successful
3. 3 -> 4: Arsenal to Arsenal, successful
4. 4 -> 5: Arsenal to Chelsea, not successful (streak breaks)  
    ...  
    
5. 1 -> 2: Arsenal to Arsenal, successful
6. 2 -> 3: Arsenal to Arsenal, successful

Chelsea's passes:  
5. 6 -> 7: Chelsea to Chelsea, successful  
6. 7 -> 8: Chelsea to Chelsea, successful  
7. 8 -> 6: Chelsea to Chelsea, successful  
8. 6 -> 5: Chelsea to Chelsea, successful  
...  

Wait, the pass details should be in timestamp order, not by team. Let me redo this:

1. 1 -> 2 (00:05): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 1)
2. 2 -> 3 (00:07): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 2)
3. 3 -> 4 (00:08): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 3)
4. 4 -> 5 (00:10): Arsenal to Chelsea, not successful (Arsenal streak breaks, count = 3)
5. 6 -> 7 (00:15): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 1)
6. 7 -> 8 (00:17): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 2)
7. 8 -> 6 (00:20): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 3)
8. 6 -> 5 (00:22): Chelsea to Arsenal, not successful (Chelsea streak breaks, count = 3)
9. 1 -> 2 (00:25): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 1)
10. 2 -> 3 (00:27): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 2)

So, Arsenal's longest streak is 3, and Chelsea's longest streak is 3. But the expected output says Chelsea's longest streak is 4. Let me check the problem description again.

From the explanation: "Chelsea's streaks: First streak: 3 passes (6→7→8→6→5)".

Wait, that's 4 passes, not 3. Let me trace through it again:  
5. 6 -> 7 (00:15): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 1)  
6. 7 -> 8 (00:17): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 2)  
7. 8 -> 6 (00:20): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 3)  
8. 6 -> 5 (00:22): Chelsea to Arsenal, not successful (Chelsea streak breaks, count = 3)  

Hmm, that's still 3. Let me check the data:

- Pass 5: 6 -> 7
- Pass 6: 7 -> 8
- Pass 7: 8 -> 6
- Pass 8: 6 -> 5

That's 4 players involved (6, 7, 8, 5), but only 4 passes. I think the explanation in the problem might be incorrect.

But wait, I need to be careful about my trace. I need to check the `Teams` table to see which team player 5 belongs to:

From the `Teams` table:

```Plain
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | team_name |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | Arsenal   |
| 2         | Arsenal   |
| 3         | Arsenal   |
| 4         | Arsenal   |
| 5         | Chelsea   |
| 6         | Chelsea   |
| 7         | Chelsea   |
| 8         | Chelsea   |
+-----------+-----------+
```

So player 5 belongs to Chelsea.

Let me trace through the passes again:

- Pass 1: 1 -> 2 (00:05): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 1)
- Pass 2: 2 -> 3 (00:07): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 2)
- Pass 3: 3 -> 4 (00:08): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 3)
- Pass 4: 4 -> 5 (00:10): Arsenal to Chelsea, not successful (Arsenal streak breaks, count = 3)
- Pass 5: 6 -> 7 (00:15): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 1)
- Pass 6: 7 -> 8 (00:17): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 2)
- Pass 7: 8 -> 6 (00:20): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 3)
- Pass 8: 6 -> 5 (00:22): Chelsea to Chelsea, successful (Chelsea streak 4) (since player 5 is Chelsea)
- Pass 9: 1 -> 2 (00:25): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 1)
- Pass 10: 2 -> 3 (00:27): Arsenal to Arsenal, successful (Arsenal streak 2)

So Chelsea's longest streak is 4, which matches the expected output.

Now, let's return to our approach. We need to group consecutive successful passes by team, where a streak breaks when a pass is intercepted.

One approach is to use a "gaps and islands" technique to identify streaks. We can use window functions to help with this:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(1 - is_successful) OVER (PARTITION BY from_team ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
),
streak_lengths AS (
    SELECT
        from_team,
        streak_group,
        SUM(is_successful) AS streak_length
    FROM
        streak_groups
    GROUP BY
        from_team, streak_group
)
SELECT
    from_team,
    MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM
    streak_lengths
GROUP BY
    from_team
ORDER BY
    from_team
```

I believe this approach will work as expected. Let's trace it with our example data.

For Arsenal:

- Pass 1: 1 -> 2 (00:05): Arsenal to Arsenal, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 2: 2 -> 3 (00:07): Arsenal to Arsenal, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 3: 3 -> 4 (00:08): Arsenal to Arsenal, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 4: 4 -> 5 (00:10): Arsenal to Chelsea, is_successful = 0, streak_group = 1
- Pass 9: 1 -> 2 (00:25): Arsenal to Arsenal, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 1
- Pass 10: 2 -> 3 (00:27): Arsenal to Arsenal, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 1

For Chelsea:

- Pass 5: 6 -> 7 (00:15): Chelsea to Chelsea, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 6: 7 -> 8 (00:17): Chelsea to Chelsea, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 7: 8 -> 6 (00:20): Chelsea to Chelsea, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0
- Pass 8: 6 -> 5 (00:22): Chelsea to Chelsea, is_successful = 1, streak_group = 0

For Arsenal, we have two streak groups:

- Group 0: 3 successful passes
- Group 1: 2 successful passes  
    So Arsenal's longest streak is 3.  
    

For Chelsea, we have one streak group:

- Group 0: 4 successful passes  
    So Chelsea's longest streak is 4.  
    

This matches the expected output, so our approach seems correct.

But wait, I just noticed a potential issue. The `streak_group` for Chelsea's Pass 8 should still be 0, but if Pass 8 is from Chelsea to Arsenal, then `is_successful` would be 0, which would make `streak_group` increase to 1. Let me check the data again.

I checked earlier and player 5 belongs to Chelsea. So Pass 8 (6 -> 5) should be a successful pass for Chelsea, and `is_successful` should be 1, which means `streak_group` stays 0. This aligns with our trace, which gives Chelsea a longest streak of 4.

I think our approach is correct. Let's put it all together:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(1 - is_successful) OVER (PARTITION BY from_team ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
),
streak_lengths AS (
    SELECT
        from_team,
        streak_group,
        SUM(is_successful) AS streak_length
    FROM
        streak_groups
    GROUP BY
        from_team, streak_group
)
SELECT
    from_team AS team_name,
    MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM
    streak_lengths
GROUP BY
    from_team
ORDER BY
    from_team
```

Actually, there's a subtlety with the running sum calculation. If a team has an interception as their very first pass, their first streak group should still be 0, not 1. Let's clarify the logic:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(CASE WHEN is_successful = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (PARTITION BY from_team ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
),
streak_lengths AS (
    SELECT
        from_team,
        streak_group,
        SUM(is_successful) AS streak_length
    FROM
        streak_groups
    GROUP BY
        from_team, streak_group
)
SELECT
    from_team AS team_name,
    MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM
    streak_lengths
GROUP BY
    from_team
ORDER BY
    from_team
```

Actually, I think the original SUM(1 - is_successful) approach is correct, so I'll stick with that.

I believe our approach is correct. Let's finalize the solution:

```SQL
WITH pass_details AS (
    SELECT
        p.pass_from,
        p.time_stamp,
        p.pass_to,
        t1.team_name AS from_team,
        t2.team_name AS to_team,
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE 0  -- Interception
        END AS is_successful
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    ORDER BY
        p.time_stamp
),
streak_groups AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        SUM(1 - is_successful) OVER (PARTITION BY from_team ORDER BY time_stamp) AS streak_group
    FROM
        pass_details
),
streak_lengths AS (
    SELECT
        from_team,
        streak_group,
        SUM(is_successful) AS streak_length
    FROM
        streak_groups
    GROUP BY
        from_team, streak_group
)
SELECT
    from_team AS team_name,
    MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
FROM
    streak_lengths
GROUP BY
    from_team
ORDER BY
    from_team
```

I'm confident this solution should work as expected, providing the longest successful pass streak for each team as required.

</SQL Solution>  

This solution finds the longest streak of successful passes for each team using a "gaps and islands" technique. Let me explain the approach step by step:

1. **Creating Pass Details (First CTE):**
    - I join the Passes table with the Teams table twice to identify both the passer's team and the receiver's team
    - For each pass, I determine if it's successful (same team) or an interception (different teams)
    - A pass is successful when from_team equals to_team, earning a value of 1; otherwise, it's an interception with a value of 0
2. **Identifying Streak Groups (Second CTE):**
    - The key insight is using a running sum to identify consecutive successful passes
    - The expression `SUM(1 - is_successful) OVER (PARTITION BY from_team ORDER BY time_stamp)` creates distinct streak groups
    - When a pass is successful (is_successful = 1), the sum doesn't increase
    - When an interception occurs (is_successful = 0), the sum increases by 1, creating a new streak group
    - This elegantly separates consecutive successful passes into distinct groups for each team
3. **Calculating Streak Lengths (Third CTE):**
    - For each team and streak group, I sum the successful passes to get the streak length
    - This gives us the length of each continuous successful passing sequence
4. **Finding the Longest Streak (Final Query):**
    - I then find the maximum streak length for each team
    - Results are ordered by team_name as required

When applied to the example data, this solution correctly identifies:

- Arsenal's longest streak as 3 passes (players 1→2→3→4, broken when player 4 passed to Chelsea's player 5)
- Chelsea's longest streak as 4 passes (players 6→7→8→6→5)

This approach efficiently handles the requirement to find consecutive successful passes and automatically resets the count when interceptions occur.
