**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+------------+---------+
| Column Name| Type    |
+------------+---------+
| product_id | int     |
| category   | varchar |
| price      | decimal |
+------------+---------+
product_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row includes the product's ID, its category, and its price.
```

Table: `Discounts`

```Plain
+------------+---------+
| Column Name| Type    |
+------------+---------+
| category   | varchar |
| discount   | int     |
+------------+---------+
category is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains a product category and the percentage discount applied to that category (values range from 0 to 100).
```

Write a solution to find the **final price** of each product after applying the **category discount**. If a product's category has **no associated discount**, its price remains **unchanged**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `product_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Products` table:

```Plain
+------------+-------------+-------+
| product_id | category    | price |
+------------+-------------+-------+
| 1          | Electronics | 1000  |
| 2          | Clothing    | 50    |
| 3          | Electronics | 1200  |
| 4          | Home        | 500   |
+------------+-------------+-------+
```

`Discounts` table:

```Plain
+------------+----------+
| category   | discount |
+------------+----------+
| Electronics| 10       |
| Clothing   | 20       |
+------------+----------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+------------+------------+-------------+
| product_id | final_price| category    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 1          | 900        | Electronics |
| 2          | 40         | Clothing    |
| 3          | 1080       | Electronics |
| 4          | 500        | Home        |
+------------+------------+-------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For product 1, it belongs to the Electronics category which has a  
    10% discount, so the final price is 1000 - (10% of 1000) = 900.  
    
- For product 2, it belongs to the Clothing category which has a 20% discount, so the final price is 50 - (20% of 50) = 40.
- For product 3, it belongs to the Electronics category and receives a 10% discount, so the final price is 1200 - (10% of 1200) = 1080.
- For product 4, no discount is available for the Home category, so the final price remains 500.

Result table is ordered by product_id in ascending order.

**Solutions**

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution using a **Left Join**, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Apply discounts to products based on their category.
2. If a category has no discount, the product price remains unchanged.
3. Return the final price for each product, ordered by `product_id` in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Use a **Left Join** to combine `Products` and `Discounts` tables.
- Calculate the final price by applying the discount (if available).
- Handle cases where no discount exists for a category.

---

### **Step 2: Perform a Left Join**

First, join the `Products` table with the `Discounts` table on the `category` column.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.category,
    p.price,
    d.discount
FROM
    Products p
LEFT JOIN
    Discounts d ON p.category = d.category
```

**Explanation:**

- `**LEFT JOIN**`: Ensures all products are included in the result, even if they have no matching discount.
- `**ON p.category = d.category**`: Matches products to their respective discounts based on category.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Final Price**

Next, calculate the final price by applying the discount (if available).

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    CASE
        WHEN d.discount IS NOT NULL THEN ROUND(p.price * (1 - d.discount / 100), 2)
        ELSE p.price
    END AS final_price,
    p.category
FROM
    Products p
LEFT JOIN
    Discounts d ON p.category = d.category
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CASE**` **Statement**:
    - If a discount exists (`d.discount IS NOT NULL`), calculate the final price as `price * (1 - discount / 100)`.
    - If no discount exists, keep the original price.
- `**ROUND(..., 2)**`: Rounds the final price to 2 decimal places.

---

### **Step 4: Order the Result**

Finally, order the result by `product_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    CASE
        WHEN d.discount IS NOT NULL THEN ROUND(p.price * (1 - d.discount / 100), 2)
        ELSE p.price
    END AS final_price,
    p.category
FROM
    Products p
LEFT JOIN
    Discounts d ON p.category = d.category
ORDER BY
    p.product_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ORDER BY p.product_id ASC**`: Sorts the result by `product_id` in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    CASE
        WHEN d.discount IS NOT NULL THEN ROUND(p.price * (1 - d.discount / 100), 2)
        ELSE p.price
    END AS final_price,
    p.category
FROM
    Products p
LEFT JOIN
    Discounts d ON p.category = d.category
ORDER BY
    p.product_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **Left Join**: Combines `Products` and `Discounts` tables, ensuring all products are included.
2. **Final Price Calculation**: Applies the discount (if available) and rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
3. **Ordering**: Sorts the result by `product_id` in ascending order.

This query returns the desired output, listing each product’s final price after applying the category discount, ordered by `product_id`.
