**Description**

Table: `ParkingTransactions`

```Plain
+--------------+-----------+
| Column Name  | Type      |
+--------------+-----------+
| lot_id       | int       |
| car_id       | int       |
| entry_time   | datetime  |
| exit_time    | datetime  |
| fee_paid     | decimal   |
+--------------+-----------+
(lot_id, car_id, entry_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of the parking lot, the ID of the car, the entry and exit times, and the fee paid for the parking duration.
```

Write a solution to find the **total parking fee** paid by each car **across all parking lots**, and the **average hourly fee** (rounded to `2` decimal places) paid by **each** car. Also, find the **parking lot** where each car spent the **most total time**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `car_id` _in **ascending** order._

**Note:** Test cases are generated in such a way that an individual car cannot be in multiple parking lots at the same time.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

ParkingTransactions table:

```Plain
+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+
| lot_id | car_id | entry_time          | exit_time           | fee_paid |
+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+
| 1      | 1001   | 2023-06-01 08:00:00 | 2023-06-01 10:30:00 | 5.00     |
| 1      | 1001   | 2023-06-02 11:00:00 | 2023-06-02 12:45:00 | 3.00     |
| 2      | 1001   | 2023-06-01 10:45:00 | 2023-06-01 12:00:00 | 6.00     |
| 2      | 1002   | 2023-06-01 09:00:00 | 2023-06-01 11:30:00 | 4.00     |
| 3      | 1001   | 2023-06-03 07:00:00 | 2023-06-03 09:00:00 | 4.00     |
| 3      | 1002   | 2023-06-02 12:00:00 | 2023-06-02 14:00:00 | 2.00     |
+--------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+--------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
| car_id | total_fee_paid | avg_hourly_fee | most_time_lot |
+--------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
| 1001   | 18.00          | 2.40           | 1             |
| 1002   | 6.00           | 1.33           | 2             |
+--------+----------------+----------------+---------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For car ID 1001: Total fee paid: 18.00, total hours: 7.5, average hourly fee: 2.40, most time spent in lot 1: 4.25 hours.
    - From 2023-06-01 08:00:00 to 2023-06-01 10:30:00 in lot 1: 2.5 hours, fee 5.00
    - From 2023-06-02 11:00:00 to 2023-06-02 12:45:00 in lot 1: 1.75 hours, fee 3.00
    - From 2023-06-01 10:45:00 to 2023-06-01 12:00:00 in lot 2: 1.25 hours, fee 6.00
    - From 2023-06-03 07:00:00 to 2023-06-03 09:00:00 in lot 3: 2 hours, fee 4.00
- For car ID 1002: Total fee paid: 6.00, total hours: 4.5, average hourly fee: 1.33, most time spent in lot 2: 2.5 hours.
    - From 2023-06-01 09:00:00 to 2023-06-01 11:30:00 in lot 2: 2.5 hours, fee 4.00
    - From 2023-06-02 12:00:00 to 2023-06-02 14:00:00 in lot 3: 2 hours, fee 2.00

**Note:** Output table is ordered by car_id in ascending order.

  

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

We need to analyze parking transaction data to find:

1. **Total parking fee paid by each car** across all parking lots.
2. **Average hourly fee** paid by each car, rounded to 2 decimal places.
3. **Parking lot where each car spent the most total time**.

The result should be ordered by `car_id` in ascending order.

**Step 2: Basic SQL Structure**

```SQL
SELECT
    car_id
FROM
    ParkingTransactions
GROUP BY
    car_id
ORDER BY
    car_id;
```

**Explanation:** We start by selecting `car_id` and grouping the data by `car_id` to prepare for aggregations. The `ORDER BY` clause ensures the result is sorted by `car_id`.

**Step 3: Calculate Total Fee Paid**

```SQL
SELECT
    car_id,
    SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid
FROM
    ParkingTransactions
GROUP BY
    car_id
ORDER BY
    car_id;
```

**Explanation:** We add `SUM(fee_paid)` to calculate the total fee paid by each car across all transactions.

**Step 4: Calculate Total Hours Parked**

```SQL
SELECT
    car_id,
    SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid,
    SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, entry_time, exit_time) +
           (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time) % 60) / 60.0) AS total_hours
FROM
    ParkingTransactions
GROUP BY
    car_id
ORDER BY
    car_id;
```

**Explanation:** We calculate total hours parked by each car using `TIMESTAMPDIFF` for hours and minutes, then convert minutes to fractional hours.

**Step 5: Calculate Average Hourly Fee**

```SQL
SELECT
    car_id,
    SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid,
    SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, entry_time, exit_time) +
           (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time) % 60) / 60.0) AS total_hours,
    ROUND(SUM(fee_paid) / SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, entry_time, exit_time) +
                 (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time) % 60) / 60.0), 2) AS avg_hourly_fee
FROM
    ParkingTransactions
GROUP BY
    car_id
ORDER BY
    car_id;
```

**Explanation:** We calculate the average hourly fee by dividing `total_fee_paid` by `total_hours` and rounding to 2 decimal places.

**Step 6: Find Most Time Spent Lot**

```SQL
WITH CarHours AS (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        lot_id,
        SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, entry_time, exit_time) +
               (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time) % 60) / 60.0) AS hours_in_lot
    FROM
        ParkingTransactions
    GROUP BY
        car_id, lot_id
),
RankedLots AS (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        lot_id,
        hours_in_lot,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY hours_in_lot DESC) AS lot_rank
    FROM
        CarHours
)
SELECT
    r.car_id,
    SUM(p.fee_paid) AS total_fee_paid,
    ROUND(SUM(p.fee_paid) / SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, p.entry_time, p.exit_time) +
                   (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, p.entry_time, p.exit_time) % 60) / 60.0), 2) AS avg_hourly_fee,
    r.most_time_lot
FROM
    ParkingTransactions p
JOIN (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        lot_id AS most_time_lot
    FROM
        RankedLots
    WHERE
        lot_rank = 1
) r ON p.car_id = r.car_id
GROUP BY
    p.car_id, r.most_time_lot
ORDER BY
    p.car_id;
```

**Explanation:** We use CTEs to calculate hours spent in each lot and rank them. Then, we join the ranked lots with the original table to get the desired result.

**Final Solution:**

```SQL
WITH CarHours AS (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        lot_id,
        SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, entry_time, exit_time) +
               (TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, entry_time, exit_time) % 60) / 60.0) AS hours_in_lot,
        SUM(fee_paid) AS total_fee
    FROM
        ParkingTransactions
    GROUP BY
        car_id, lot_id
),
RankedLots AS (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        lot_id,
        hours_in_lot,
        total_fee,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY car_id ORDER BY hours_in_lot DESC) AS lot_rank
    FROM
        CarHours
),
AggregatedFees AS (
    SELECT
        car_id,
        SUM(total_fee) AS total_fee_paid,
        SUM(hours_in_lot) AS total_hours
    FROM
        CarHours
    GROUP BY
        car_id
)
SELECT
    a.car_id,
    a.total_fee_paid,
    ROUND(a.total_fee_paid / a.total_hours, 2) AS avg_hourly_fee,
    r.lot_id AS most_time_lot
FROM
    AggregatedFees a
JOIN
    RankedLots r ON a.car_id = r.car_id
WHERE
    r.lot_rank = 1
ORDER BY
    a.car_id;
```

**Explanation:** This query calculates total fees, total hours, and average hourly fees per car, then identifies the lot where each car spent the most time. The final result is ordered by `car_id`.
