**Description**

Table: `Scores`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| player_name   | varchar |
| gender        | varchar |
| day           | date    |
| score_points  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(gender, day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
A competition is held between the female team and the male team.
Each row of this table indicates that a player_name and with gender has scored score_point in someday.
Gender is 'F' if the player is in the female team and 'M' if the player is in the male team.
```

Write a solution to find the total score for each gender on each day.

Return the result table ordered by `gender` and `day` in **ascending order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Scores table:
+-------------+--------+------------+--------------+
| player_name | gender | day        | score_points |
+-------------+--------+------------+--------------+
| Aron        | F      | 2020-01-01 | 17           |
| Alice       | F      | 2020-01-07 | 23           |
| Bajrang     | M      | 2020-01-07 | 7            |
| Khali       | M      | 2019-12-25 | 11           |
| Slaman      | M      | 2019-12-30 | 13           |
| Joe         | M      | 2019-12-31 | 3            |
| Jose        | M      | 2019-12-18 | 2            |
| Priya       | F      | 2019-12-31 | 23           |
| Priyanka    | F      | 2019-12-30 | 17           |
+-------------+--------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------+------------+-------+
| gender | day        | total |
+--------+------------+-------+
| F      | 2019-12-30 | 17    |
| F      | 2019-12-31 | 40    |
| F      | 2020-01-01 | 57    |
| F      | 2020-01-07 | 80    |
| M      | 2019-12-18 | 2     |
| M      | 2019-12-25 | 13    |
| M      | 2019-12-30 | 26    |
| M      | 2019-12-31 | 29    |
| M      | 2020-01-07 | 36    |
+--------+------------+-------+
Explanation:
For the female team:
The first day is 2019-12-30, Priyanka scored 17 points and the total score for the team is 17.
The second day is 2019-12-31, Priya scored 23 points and the total score for the team is 40.
The third day is 2020-01-01, Aron scored 17 points and the total score for the team is 57.
The fourth day is 2020-01-07, Alice scored 23 points and the total score for the team is 80.

For the male team:
The first day is 2019-12-18, Jose scored 2 points and the total score for the team is 2.
The second day is 2019-12-25, Khali scored 11 points and the total score for the team is 13.
The third day is 2019-12-30, Slaman scored 13 points and the total score for the team is 26.
The fourth day is 2019-12-31, Joe scored 3 points and the total score for the team is 29.
The fifth day is 2020-01-07, Bajrang scored 7 points and the total score for the team is 36.
```

Looking at this SQL problem, I'll analyze the solution in detail, then explain how the query works to calculate the running total scores by gender and day.

## Problem Analysis

The task is to find the total score for each gender on each day, with results ordered by gender and day in ascending order. The key insight is that we need a running total of scores for each gender as the days progress.

## Solution Explanation

```SQL
SELECT
    gender,
    day,
    SUM(score_points) OVER (
        PARTITION BY gender
        ORDER BY gender, day
    ) AS total
FROM Scores;
```

Let's break this down:

### 1. Window Function Approach

This solution uses a window function with:

- `SUM(score_points) OVER (...)` - Calculates a running sum
- `PARTITION BY gender` - Creates separate calculations for each gender
- `ORDER BY gender, day` - Defines the order for the running sum, ensuring it accumulates chronologically

### 2. Row-by-Row Execution

For the female team, the query processes rows in this sequence:

1. First row (2019-12-30): Sum = 17
2. Second row (2019-12-31): Sum = 17 + 23 = 40
3. Third row (2020-01-01): Sum = 40 + 17 = 57
4. Fourth row (2020-01-07): Sum = 57 + 23 = 80

For the male team, it follows the same pattern, starting fresh with a new partition.

### 3. No Explicit GROUP BY

The solution doesn't use a traditional GROUP BY clause because:

- The window function handles the aggregation within each partition
- The query needs to return every row from the original data, not collapsed groups

## Alternate Approaches

An alternative approach could use a subquery with joins:

```SQL
SELECT
    s1.gender,
    s1.day,
    SUM(s2.score_points) AS total
FROM
    Scores s1
    JOIN Scores s2 ON s1.gender = s2.gender AND s2.day <= s1.day
GROUP BY
    s1.gender, s1.day
ORDER BY
    s1.gender, s1.day;
```

However, the window function approach is more elegant and typically performs better.

## Performance Considerations

The window function solution:

- Requires only a single pass through the data
- Scales better with larger datasets
- Is more readable and maintainable

## Edge Cases Handling

The solution correctly handles:

- Multiple players with the same gender scoring on the same day
- Days with no scores for a particular gender (they simply won't appear in the output)
- The ordering requirement (ascending by gender and day)

The window function approach elegantly handles the running total calculation while maintaining the required sorting, making it an optimal solution for this problem.
