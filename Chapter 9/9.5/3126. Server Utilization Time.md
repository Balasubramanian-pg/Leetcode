**Description**

Table: `Servers`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| server_id      | int      |
| status_time    | datetime |
| session_status | enum     |
+----------------+----------+
(server_id, status_time, session_status) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
session_status is an ENUM (category) type of ('start', 'stop').
Each row of this table contains server_id, status_time, and session_status.
```

Write a solution to find the **total time** when servers were **running**. The output should be rounded down to the nearest number of **full days**.

Return _the result table in **any** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Explanation:**

- For server ID 3: Total for server 3: ~13.48 hours
    - From 2023-11-04 16:29:47 to 2023-11-05 01:49:47: ~9.3 hours
    - From 2023-11-25 01:37:08 to 2023-11-25 03:50:08: ~2.2 hours
    - From 2023-11-04 23:16:48 to 2023-11-05 01:15:48: ~1.98 hours
- For server ID 1: Total for server 1: ~9.23 hours
    - From 2023-11-13 03:05:31 to 2023-11-13 11:10:31: ~8 hours
    - From 2023-11-20 00:27:11 to 2023-11-20 01:41:11: ~1.23 hours
- For server ID 4: Total for server 4: ~20.52 hours
    - From 2023-11-29 15:11:17 to 2023-11-29 15:42:17: ~0.52 hours
    - From 2023-11-20 00:31:44 to 2023-11-20 07:03:44: ~6.53 hours
    - From 2023-11-30 15:09:18 to 2023-11-30 20:48:18: ~5.65 hours
    - From 2023-11-25 21:09:06 to 2023-11-26 04:58:06: ~7.82 hours
- For server ID 5: Total for server 5: ~1.43 hours
    - From 2023-11-16 19:42:22 to 2023-11-16 21:08:22: ~1.43 hours

The accumulated runtime for all servers totals approximately 44.46  
hours, equivalent to one full day plus some additional hours. However,  
since we consider only full days, the final output is rounded to 1 full  
day.  

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the problem  
We need to calculate the total running time of all servers and convert it to full days (rounded down). Each server has "start" and "stop" timestamps, and we need to calculate the difference between each pair.  

Step 2: Pair each "start" with its corresponding "stop" event  
First, we need to match each "start" event with its corresponding "stop" event for each server:  

```SQL
WITH server_sessions AS (
    SELECT
        server_id,
        status_time AS start_time,
        LEAD(status_time) OVER (PARTITION BY server_id ORDER BY status_time) AS stop_time
    FROM
        Servers
    WHERE
        session_status = 'start'
)
```

Explanation: This query uses the LEAD window function to get the next status_time for each server after a "start" event. However, this approach won't work correctly because we need to ensure we're pairing each "start" with its proper "stop" event, not just the next timestamp.

Step 3: Let's use a better approach to pair start and stop events

Let me explain this SQL solution step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
We need to find the total time when servers were running across all servers. This means:  

1. We must pair each "start" event with its corresponding "stop" event
2. Calculate the duration between each pair
3. Sum all these durations
4. Convert the total time to days and round down to the nearest whole day

Step 2: Pairing Start and Stop Events

```SQL
WITH paired_sessions AS (
    SELECT
        s1.server_id,
        s1.status_time AS start_time,
        MIN(s2.status_time) AS stop_time
    FROM
        Servers s1
    JOIN
        Servers s2
        ON s1.server_id = s2.server_id
        AND s1.status_time < s2.status_time
        AND s1.session_status = 'start'
        AND s2.session_status = 'stop'
    GROUP BY
        s1.server_id, s1.status_time
)
```

Explanation: This CTE (Common Table Expression) pairs each "start" event with its corresponding "stop" event by:

- Joining the Servers table with itself
- Matching records for the same server_id
- Ensuring the start_time is before the stop_time
- Confirming s1 is a 'start' event and s2 is a 'stop' event
- Using MIN to get the nearest 'stop' event after each 'start' event

This way, we get proper pairs of start and stop times for each server session.

Step 3: Calculating Total Uptime

```SQL
total_uptime AS (
    SELECT
        SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, start_time, stop_time)) / (24*60*60) AS total_days_decimal
    FROM
        paired_sessions
)
```

Explanation: This CTE:

- Calculates the time difference between each start and stop time in seconds using TIMESTAMPDIFF
- Sums these differences to get the total running time in seconds
- Divides by the number of seconds in a day (24_60_60 = 86,400) to convert to days

Step 4: Rounding Down to Full Days

```SQL
SELECT
    FLOOR(total_days_decimal) AS total_uptime_days
FROM
    total_uptime
```

Explanation: The final query:

- Uses the FLOOR function to round down to the nearest whole day
- Returns this value as total_uptime_days

This solution correctly handles the pairing of start and stop events, calculates the time differences, and converts the total to full days as required. The FLOOR function ensures we're getting the number of complete days without including partial days.

In the example data, the total running time across all servers was approximately 44.46 hours, which is roughly 1.85 days. When rounded down to the nearest full day, we get 1 day as the output, matching the expected result.

```SQL
WITH paired_sessions AS (
    SELECT 
        s1.server_id,
        s1.status_time AS start_time,
        MIN(s2.status_time) AS stop_time
    FROM 
        Servers s1
    JOIN 
        Servers s2 
        ON s1.server_id = s2.server_id 
        AND s1.status_time < s2.status_time
        AND s1.session_status = 'start'
        AND s2.session_status = 'stop'
    GROUP BY 
        s1.server_id, s1.status_time
),
total_uptime AS (
    SELECT 
        SUM(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, start_time, stop_time)) / (24*60*60) AS total_days_decimal
    FROM 
        paired_sessions
)

SELECT 
    FLOOR(total_days_decimal) AS total_uptime_days
FROM 
    total_uptime;
```
