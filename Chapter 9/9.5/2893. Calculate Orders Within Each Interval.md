**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| minute      | int  |
| order_count | int  |
+-------------+------+
minute is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the minute and number of orders received during that specific minute. The total number of rows will be a multiple of 6.
```

Write a query to calculate **total orders** within each **interval**. Each interval is defined as a combination of `6` minutes.

- Minutes `1` to `6` fall within interval `1`, while minutes `7` to `12` belong to interval `2`, and so forth.

Return _the result table ordered by **interval_no** in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+--------+-------------+
| minute | order_count |
+--------+-------------+
| 1      | 0           |
| 2      | 2           |
| 3      | 4           |
| 4      | 6           |
| 5      | 1           |
| 6      | 4           |
| 7      | 1           |
| 8      | 2           |
| 9      | 4           |
| 10     | 1           |
| 11     | 4           |
| 12     | 6           |
+--------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+--------------+
| interval_no | total_orders |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | 17           |
| 2           | 18           |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
- Interval number 1 comprises minutes from 1 to 6. The total orders in these six minutes are (0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 4) = 17.
- Interval number 2 comprises minutes from 7 to 12. The total orders in these six minutes are (1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 6) = 18.
Returning table orderd by interval_no in ascending order.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to group the order counts from the `Orders` table into blocks of 6 minutes and find the total orders within each block.

The first block is minutes 1-6, the second is 7-12, and so on. We need to output the interval number and the total orders for that interval, ordered by the interval number.

We'll be working with the `Orders` table, specifically the `minute` and `order_count` columns.

Step 1: We need to figure out which "interval" each `minute` belongs to. The problem states that minutes 1-6 are interval 1, 7-12 are interval 2, etc.

We can find the interval number for a given minute by dividing the minute by 6 (making sure to handle the boundaries correctly) and taking the ceiling, or by adjusting the minute first.

A reliable way is `CEIL(minute / 6.0)`. Using `6.0` ensures that the division is done using decimals, and `CEIL()` rounds up to the next whole number.

```SQL
SELECT
    minute,
    order_count,
    -- Calculate the interval number for each minute
    CEIL(minute / 6.0) AS interval_no_calc
FROM Orders;
-- This adds a calculated column showing which 6-minute interval each row falls into.
```

Explanation: We select the `minute` and `order_count` columns from the `Orders` table. We also calculate `CEIL(minute / 6.0)`.

- `minute / 6.0`: This divides the minute number by 6 as a decimal number. For example, 1/6.0 is 0.166..., 6/6.0 is 1.0, 7/6.0 is 1.166..., 12/6.0 is 2.0, etc.
- `CEIL(...)`: This function rounds a number _up_ to the nearest whole integer. So, CEIL(0.166...) through CEIL(1.0) become 1, CEIL(1.166...) through CEIL(2.0) become 2, and so on. This correctly assigns minute 1-6 to interval 1, 7-12 to interval 2, etc. We give this calculated column a temporary name `interval_no_calc`.

Step 2: Now that we know which interval each minute belongs to, we need to group the rows by this calculated interval number and sum the `order_count` within each group.

```SQL
SELECT
    -- Group by the calculated interval number
    CEIL(minute / 6.0) AS interval_no,
    -- Sum the order count for all minutes in the same interval
    SUM(order_count) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CEIL(minute / 6.0); -- Grouping needs to use the same calculation as the selection
-- This groups the minutes by their calculated interval number and sums the order counts within each interval.
```

Explanation: We group the rows of the `Orders` table using `GROUP BY CEIL(minute / 6.0)`. This puts all rows belonging to the same interval into a single group. In the `SELECT` list, we calculate the `interval_no` again (or we could just use the calculation directly if not aliasing) and use `SUM(order_count)` to add up all the `order_count` values for the minutes within that group. We name the sum `total_orders`.

Step 3: Finally, the problem requires the result table to be ordered by `interval_no` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    CEIL(minute / 6.0) AS interval_no,
    SUM(order_count) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CEIL(minute / 6.0)
ORDER BY interval_no ASC; -- Order the final output by interval number
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY interval_no ASC` at the end of the query. This sorts the final result rows based on the `interval_no` column from smallest to largest. Note that we can use the alias `interval_no` in the `ORDER BY` clause.

This query correctly calculates the interval number for each minute, groups by the interval, sums the orders, and orders the final result.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    CEIL(minute / 6.0) AS interval_no,
    SUM(order_count) AS total_orders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CEIL(minute / 6.0)
ORDER BY interval_no ASC;
```
