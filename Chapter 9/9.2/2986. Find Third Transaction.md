**Description**

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     |
+------------------+----------+
| user_id          | int      |
| spend            | decimal  |
| transaction_date | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
(user_id, transaction_date) is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains user_id, spend, and transaction_date.
```

Write a solution to find the **third transaction** (if they have at least three transactions) of every user, where the **spending** on the preceding **two transactions** is **lower** than the spending on the **third** transaction.

Return _the result table by_ `user_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Transactions table:
+---------+--------+---------------------+

+---------+-------------------------+------------------------+
Explanation
- For user_id 1, their third transaction occurred on 2023-11-18 at 13:49:42 with an amount of $65.56, surpassing the expenditures of the previous two transactions which were $7.44 on 2023-11-02 at 12:15:23 and $49.78 on 2023-11-12 at 00:13:46. Thus, this third transaction will be included in the output table.
- user_id 2 only has a total of 2 transactions, so there isn't a third transaction to consider.
- For user_id 3, the amount of $7.0 for their third transaction is less than that of the preceding two transactions, so it won't be included.
Output table is ordered by user_id in ascending order.

```

**Solution 1**

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id
                ORDER BY transaction_date
            ) AS rk,
            spend > (
                LAG(spend) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_id
                    ORDER BY transaction_date
                )
            )
            AND spend > (
                LAG(spend, 2) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_id
                    ORDER BY transaction_date
                )
            ) AS st
        FROM Transactions
    )
SELECT user_id, spend AS third_transaction_spend, transaction_date AS third_transaction_date
FROM T
WHERE rk = 3 AND st = 1;
```

Okay, let's break down this SQL query step by step.

The goal is to find the _third_ transaction for each user, but only if that third transaction's spending amount was _higher_ than the spending amounts of _both_ the first and second transactions for that user. We need to return the user ID, the spend amount of that third transaction, and its date, ordered by user ID.

The provided solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) and window functions.

Step 1: We start by preparing the data using a CTE named `T`. Inside this CTE, we'll get all the original transaction details, plus some calculated values that will help us identify the third transaction and compare its spend to the previous ones.

```SQL
WITH T AS (
    SELECT
        *, -- Select all original columns
        -- Window functions will be added here
    FROM Transactions
)
-- This CTE will hold the original data along with some extra calculated columns.
```

Explanation: We begin by defining a temporary result set called `T`. We select all columns (`*`) from the `Transactions` table. We'll add our special calculations using window functions inside this `SELECT` statement in the next steps.

Step 2: We need to identify the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., transaction for each user based on the transaction date. The `RANK()` window function is used here. It assigns a rank to each row within a specified group, based on a specified order.

```SQL
WITH T AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        -- Assign a rank to each transaction for every user based on date
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id -- Restart ranking for each user
            ORDER BY transaction_date -- Order transactions chronologically
        ) AS rk
        -- More calculations will be added here
    FROM Transactions
)
-- The 'T' CTE now includes an 'rk' column, which is 1 for the first transaction by a user, 2 for the second, and so on.
```

Explanation: We add `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS rk`.

- `PARTITION BY user_id`: This tells the `RANK` function to perform the ranking separately for each unique `user_id`.
- `ORDER BY transaction_date`: Within each user's group, the transactions are sorted by `transaction_date` from earliest to latest.
- `RANK()`: Assigns a rank (1, 2, 3, ...) to each row in the ordered partition. The earliest transaction gets rank 1, the second earliest gets rank 2, and so on. `rk=3` will represent the third transaction for that user.

Step 3: We need to compare the `spend` of the current transaction (the one being evaluated) with the `spend` of the two transactions that occurred _before_ it for the same user. The `LAG()` window function allows us to access values from previous rows. `LAG(column, offset)` gets the value of `column` from the row `offset` positions before the current row within the window.

```SQL
WITH T AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY transaction_date
        ) AS rk,
        -- Get the spend from the previous transaction
        LAG(spend, 1) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY transaction_date
        ) AS spend_lag_1,
        -- Get the spend from the transaction two steps before
        LAG(spend, 2) OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY transaction_date
        ) AS spend_lag_2
        -- A boolean flag will be added here based on these LAG values
    FROM Transactions
)
-- The 'T' CTE now includes 'spend_lag_1' (spend of the 1st previous transaction)
-- and 'spend_lag_2' (spend of the 2nd previous transaction) for each row.
-- These values are NULL for the first two transactions of a user.
```

Explanation: We've added two more columns using `LAG()`:

- `LAG(spend, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS spend_lag_1`: Gets the `spend` value from the transaction immediately preceding the current one for the same user, ordered by date.
- `LAG(spend, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS spend_lag_2`: Gets the `spend` value from the transaction two positions before the current one for the same user, ordered by date.  
    These will be  
    `NULL` for the first transaction (`spend_lag_1`, `spend_lag_2`) and the second transaction (`spend_lag_2`).

Step 4: The problem requires the current transaction's spend to be greater than _both_ the immediately preceding spend and the spend two steps before. We can create a boolean flag (`st` in the original query) that is true (1) if this condition holds.

```SQL
WITH T AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY user_id
            ORDER BY transaction_date
        ) AS rk,
        -- Check if current spend is greater than the previous spend AND the spend two steps before
        spend > (
            LAG(spend, 1) OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id
                ORDER BY transaction_date
            )
        )
        AND spend > (
            LAG(spend, 2) OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id
                ORDER BY transaction_date
            )
        ) AS st -- This calculates the boolean flag
    FROM Transactions
)
-- The 'T' CTE now includes the 'st' column, which is 1 (true) if the current transaction's spend
-- is higher than BOTH the first and second preceding transactions' spend for that user, and 0 (false) otherwise.
```

Explanation: We add the `st` column. The expression `spend > LAG(spend, 1) OVER (...) AND spend > LAG(spend, 2) OVER (...)` checks if the `spend` of the current row is strictly greater than the spend of the row one position back AND strictly greater than the spend of the row two positions back, within the same user's ordered transactions. SQL often represents boolean true as 1 and false as 0 (or treats the boolean expression directly in `WHERE`). Note that if `LAG` returns `NULL` (which happens for the first two transactions), comparisons like `spend > NULL` evaluate to unknown, which is treated as false in filtering.

Step 5: Finally, we select the required columns (`user_id`, `spend` aliased as `third_transaction_spend`, `transaction_date` aliased as `third_transaction_date`) from the `T` CTE. We filter the results using the `WHERE` clause to keep only those rows where the rank (`rk`) is 3 (meaning it's the third transaction) AND the boolean flag (`st`) is 1 (meaning its spend was greater than the previous two).

```SQL
WITH T AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
SELECT
    user_id,
    spend AS third_transaction_spend, -- Alias spend as required
    transaction_date AS third_transaction_date -- Alias transaction_date as required
FROM T
WHERE rk = 3 -- Select only the third transaction for each user
AND st = 1; -- And only if its spend was greater than the previous two
-- This filters the CTE results to find the specific third transactions that meet the criteria.
```

Explanation: We select `user_id`, `spend` (renamed to `third_transaction_spend`), and `transaction_date` (renamed to `third_transaction_date`) from the `T` CTE. The `WHERE rk = 3 AND st = 1` condition is applied. This ensures that only the rows corresponding to the third transaction (`rk = 3`) that also satisfy the increasing spend condition (`st = 1`) are returned.

Step 6: The problem requires the result table to be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order. Although the provided solution code doesn't explicitly show `ASC`, ascending is the default order.

```SQL
WITH T AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
SELECT
    user_id,
    spend AS third_transaction_spend,
    transaction_date AS third_transaction_date
FROM T
WHERE rk = 3
AND st = 1
ORDER BY user_id ASC; -- Order the final result by user ID ascending
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY user_id ASC` to sort the final results by the `user_id` column from smallest to largest.

This complete query uses window functions to rank transactions and compare values from previous rows, allowing it to identify the specific third transactions that meet the spend criteria and return them ordered correctly.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY user_id
                ORDER BY transaction_date
            ) AS rk,
            spend > (
                LAG(spend) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_id
                    ORDER BY transaction_date
                )
            )
            AND spend > (
                LAG(spend, 2) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY user_id
                    ORDER BY transaction_date
                )
            ) AS st
        FROM Transactions
    )
SELECT user_id, spend AS third_transaction_spend, transaction_date AS third_transaction_date
FROM T
WHERE rk = 3 AND st = 1
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
```
