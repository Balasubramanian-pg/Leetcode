Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| transaction_id | int      |
| day            | datetime |
| amount         | int      |
+----------------+----------+
transaction_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about one transaction.
```

Write a solutionÂ to report the IDs of the transactions with the **maximum** `amount` on their respective day. If in one day there are multiple such transactions, return all of them.

Return the result table **ordered by** `transaction_id` **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Transactions table:
+----------------+--------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | day                | amount |
+----------------+--------------------+--------+
| 8              | 2021-4-3 15:57:28  | 57     |
| 9              | 2021-4-28 08:47:25 | 21     |
| 1              | 2021-4-29 13:28:30 | 58     |
| 5              | 2021-4-28 16:39:59 | 40     |
| 6              | 2021-4-29 23:39:28 | 58     |
+----------------+--------------------+--------+
Output:
+----------------+
| transaction_id |
+----------------+
| 1              |
| 5              |
| 6              |
| 8              |
+----------------+
Explanation:
"2021-4-3"  --> We have one transaction with ID 8, so we add 8 to the result table.
"2021-4-28" --> We have two transactions with IDs 5 and 9. The transaction with ID 5 has an amount of 40, while the transaction with ID 9 has an amount of 21. We only include the transaction with ID 5 as it has the maximum amount this day.
"2021-4-29" --> We have two transactions with IDs 1 and 6. Both transactions have the same amount of 58, so we include both in the result table.
We order the result table by transaction_id after collecting these IDs.
```

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without using the `MAX()` function?

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to find transaction IDs that have the maximum amount for each day. If multiple transactions share the maximum amount on the same day, we should include all of them. The result should be ordered by transaction_id in ascending order.

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Understand the basic table structure

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Transactions
```

Explanation: First, I'm just looking at the table structure. We have transaction_id, day, and amount columns. We need to find the maximum amount for each day.

## Step 2: Group transactions by day

```SQL
SELECT DATE(day) AS transaction_date, MAX(amount) AS max_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY DATE(day)
```

Explanation: We need to extract just the date part from the datetime column, then find the maximum amount for each date. We use DATE() function to extract only the date part from the datetime value, ignoring the time component.

## Step 3: Use a subquery to match transactions with the maximum amount

```SQL
SELECT transaction_id
FROM Transactions t
WHERE (DATE(t.day), t.amount) IN (
    SELECT DATE(day) AS transaction_date, MAX(amount) AS max_amount
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY DATE(day)
)
ORDER BY transaction_id
```

Explanation: We're creating a subquery that produces pairs of (date, max_amount). Then in the outer query, we select transaction_ids where the (date, amount) pair matches one from our subquery. This finds transactions that have the maximum amount for their day.

## Step 4: Refine the solution using JOIN

```SQL
SELECT t.transaction_id
FROM Transactions t
JOIN (
    SELECT DATE(day) AS transaction_date, MAX(amount) AS max_amount
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY DATE(day)
) max_by_day
ON DATE(t.day) = max_by_day.transaction_date AND t.amount = max_by_day.max_amount
ORDER BY t.transaction_id
```

Explanation: Another approach is to use a JOIN instead of WHERE IN. We join the Transactions table with our subquery on matching both the date and having the maximum amount for that date.

## Step 5: Solution using window functions (for the follow-up question)

```SQL
SELECT transaction_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        transaction_id,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DATE(day) ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Transactions
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY transaction_id
```

Explanation: This approach uses a window function (RANK) to assign a rank to each transaction based on its amount within each day group. Transactions with the highest amount on their day will have rank = 1. We then filter to keep only those transactions.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT transaction_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        transaction_id,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DATE(day) ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Transactions
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY transaction_id
```

This solution:

1. Uses PARTITION BY DATE(day) to group transactions by day
2. Uses ORDER BY amount DESC to rank transactions within each day group by amount (highest first)
3. Uses the RANK() function to assign a rank to each transaction
4. Filters for only the transactions with rank = 1 (the highest amount for their day)
5. Orders the result by transaction_id as required

This addresses the follow-up question by avoiding the explicit use of MAX().
