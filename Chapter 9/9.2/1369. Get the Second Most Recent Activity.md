**Description**

Table: `UserActivity`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| username      | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
| startDate     | Date    |
| endDate       | Date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicates rows.
This table contains information about the activity performed by each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed an activity from startDate to endDate.
```

Write a solution to show the **second most recent activity** of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. A user cannot perform more than one activity at the same time.

Return the result table in **any** order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Explanation:
The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.
```

**Solutions**

I'll analyze the SQL solution for finding the second most recent activity for each user.

## Problem Overview

We need to:

1. Return the second most recent activity for each user (based on startDate)
2. If a user has only one activity, return that activity

## Solution Analysis

```SQL
SELECT
    username,
    activity,
    startdate,
    enddate
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY username
                ORDER BY startdate DESC
            ) AS rk,
            COUNT(username) OVER (PARTITION BY username) AS cnt
        FROM UserActivity
    ) AS a
WHERE a.rk = 2 OR a.cnt = 1;
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

This solution uses a subquery with window functions to solve the problem:

1. **Inner Query**:
    - Selects all columns from UserActivity
    - Uses the `RANK()` window function to assign ranks to activities for each user:
        
        ```SQL
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY username ORDER BY startdate DESC) AS rk
        ```
        
        - `PARTITION BY username` - Groups records by username
        - `ORDER BY startdate DESC` - Orders activities from newest to oldest
        - Activities with the same startDate would get the same rank (though the problem states no overlaps)
    - Counts the total number of activities per user:
        
        ```SQL
        COUNT(username) OVER (PARTITION BY username) AS cnt
        ```
        
        - This helps identify users with only one activity
2. **Outer Query Filtering**:
    - The `WHERE` clause has two conditions:
        - `a.rk = 2` - Gets the second most recent activity
        - `a.cnt = 1` - Includes users who have only one activity
    - These conditions are combined with OR logic

### Example Trace

For our example data:

**Alice** has 3 activities:

- Travel (2020-02-24): rank 1
- Dancing (2020-02-21): rank 2 ✓
- Travel (2020-02-12): rank 3

**Bob** has 1 activity:

- Travel (2020-02-11): rank 1, count 1 ✓

The final result includes Alice's Dancing activity (rank 2) and Bob's only Travel activity (count 1).

## Key Insights

1. **Window Functions**: The solution elegantly uses both `RANK()` and `COUNT()` window functions to solve two aspects of the problem simultaneously.
2. **Efficiency**: The approach scans the table just once and uses SQL's built-in ranking capabilities rather than complex joins or self-joins.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution handles both users with multiple activities and users with only one activity in a single query.
4. **RANK() vs. ROW_NUMBER()**: The query uses `RANK()` rather than `ROW_NUMBER()`, which allows for handling the (unlikely) case where multiple activities have the same startDate.

## Alternative Approaches

An alternative approach could use a self-join:

```SQL
SELECT u1.username, u1.activity, u1.startDate, u1.endDate
FROM UserActivity u1
LEFT JOIN UserActivity u2
ON u1.username = u2.username AND u1.startDate < u2.startDate
GROUP BY u1.username, u1.activity, u1.startDate, u1.endDate
HAVING COUNT(u2.username) = 1 OR COUNT(*) = 0;
```

However, the window function approach is cleaner and likely more efficient, especially with larger datasets.

The provided solution is an excellent example of using SQL window functions to solve ranking problems efficiently.
