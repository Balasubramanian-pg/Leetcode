**Description**

Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about customers.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| cost          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
Each customer hasone order per day.
```

Write a solution to find the most recent three orders of  
each user. If a user ordered less than three orders, return all of their  
orders.  

Return the result table ordered by `customer_name` in **ascending order** and in case of a tie by the `customer_id` in **ascending order**. If there is still a tie, order them by `order_date` in **descending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+-------------+-----------+
| customer_id | name      |
+-------------+-----------+
| 1           | Winston   |
| 2           | Jonathan  |
| 3           | Annabelle |
| 4           | Marwan    |
| 5           | Khaled    |
+-------------+-----------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | cost |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 30   |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 40   |
| 3        | 2020-07-31 | 3           | 70   |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 100  |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 1010 |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 102  |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 111  |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 99   |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 32   |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------+
Output:
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| customer_name | customer_id | order_id | order_date |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
| Annabelle     | 3           | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| Annabelle     | 3           | 3        | 2020-07-31 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 9        | 2020-08-07 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| Jonathan      | 2           | 2        | 2020-07-30 |
| Marwan        | 4           | 4        | 2020-07-29 |
| Winston       | 1           | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| Winston       | 1           | 1        | 2020-07-31 |
| Winston       | 1           | 10       | 2020-07-15 |
+---------------+-------------+----------+------------+
Explanation:
Winston has 4 orders, we discard the order of "2020-06-10" because it is the oldest order.
Annabelle has only 2 orders, we return them.
Jonathan has exactly 3 orders.
Marwan ordered only one time.
We sort the result table by customer_name in ascending order, by customer_id in ascending order, and by order_date in descending order in case of a tie.
```

**Follow up:** Could you write a general solution for the most recent `n` orders?

## Understanding the Problem

The problem asks us to:

1. Find the most recent 3 orders for each customer
2. If a customer has fewer than 3 orders, return all of them
3. Sort the results by:
    - Customer name (ascending)
    - Customer ID (ascending) in case of a tie in names
    - Order date (descending) if there's still a tie

## The Solution Breakdown

Let's break down the SQL query step by step:

```SQL
WITH RecentOrders AS (
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name,
        o.customer_id,
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date DESC) AS order_rank
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
)
SELECT
    customer_name,
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM RecentOrders
WHERE order_rank <= 3
ORDER BY customer_name ASC, customer_id ASC, order_date DESC;
```

### 1. The CTE (Common Table Expression)

```SQL
WITH RecentOrders AS (
    -- Query content
)
```

- This creates a temporary result set named `RecentOrders` that we can reference later in the query.

### 2. Joining Tables and Ranking Orders

```SQL
SELECT
    c.name AS customer_name,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date DESC) AS order_rank
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
```

- We join the `Orders` table with the `Customers` table to get the customer name
- The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is the key to solving this problem:
    - `PARTITION BY o.customer_id`: This groups the data by customer
    - `ORDER BY o.order_date DESC`: Within each customer group, orders are ranked by date with the most recent first
    - The result is that each customer's orders get numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., with 1 being their most recent order

### 3. Filtering the Top 3 Orders

```SQL
SELECT
    customer_name,
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM RecentOrders
WHERE order_rank <= 3
```

- We only select rows from our CTE where `order_rank` is 1, 2, or 3
- This effectively gives us the 3 most recent orders for each customer
- If a customer has fewer than 3 orders, all will be included because their ranks will all be ≤ 3

### 4. Sorting the Results

```SQL
ORDER BY customer_name ASC, customer_id ASC, order_date DESC;
```

- First, we sort by `customer_name` in ascending order
- If two customers have the same name, we sort by `customer_id` in ascending order
- If there's still a tie (which could happen for multiple orders from the same customer), we sort by `order_date` in descending order

## Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through part of the example:

1. For Winston (customer_id = 1), we have 4 orders:
    
    - Order 8 on 2020-08-03 (rank 1, most recent)
    - Order 1 on 2020-07-31 (rank 2)
    - Order 10 on 2020-07-15 (rank 3)
    - Order 5 on 2020-06-10 (rank 4, oldest)
    
    Since we only keep orders with rank ≤ 3, Order 5 is discarded.
    
2. For Annabelle (customer_id = 3), we have 2 orders:
    
    - Order 7 on 2020-08-01 (rank 1)
    - Order 3 on 2020-07-31 (rank 2)
    
    Both are kept since there are fewer than 3 orders.
    
3. After processing all customers similarly, we sort the results:
    - First by customer_name: Annabelle, Jonathan, Marwan, Winston
    - For each customer, by order_date descending (most recent first)

This gives us the output shown in the example.

## Follow-up: General Solution for n Orders

To make this a general solution for the most recent `n` orders (instead of specifically 3):

```SQL
WITH RecentOrders AS (
    SELECT
        c.name AS customer_name,
        o.customer_id,
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date DESC) AS order_rank
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
)
SELECT
    customer_name,
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM RecentOrders
WHERE order_rank <= n  -- This would be a parameter
ORDER BY customer_name ASC, customer_id ASC, order_date DESC;
```

Different database systems handle parameters differently:

- In MySQL: `WHERE order_rank <= ?`
- In PostgreSQL: `WHERE order_rank <= $1`
- In SQL Server: `WHERE order_rank <= @n`
- In Oracle: `WHERE order_rank <= :n`

This allows the same query to be reused for finding the most recent 2, 5, or any number of orders per customer.
