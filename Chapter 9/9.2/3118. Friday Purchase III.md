**Description**

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| user_id       | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
| amount_spend  | int  |
+---------------+------+
(user_id, purchase_date, amount_spend) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
purchase_date will range from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, inclusive of both dates.
Each row contains user_id, purchase_date, and amount_spend.
```

Table: `Users`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| membership  | enum |
+-------------+------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
membership is an ENUM (category) type of ('Standard', 'Premium', 'VIP').
Each row of this table indicates the user_id, membership type.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **total spending** by `Premium` and `VIP` members on **each Friday of every week** in November 2023.  If there are **no purchases** on a **particular Friday** by `Premium` or `VIP` members, it should be considered as `0`.

Return _the result table_ _ordered by week of the month,  and_ `membership` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Purchases table:

```Plain
+---------+---------------+--------------+
| user_id | purchase_date | amount_spend |
+---------+---------------+--------------+
| 11      | 2023-11-03    | 1126         |
| 15      | 2023-11-10    | 7473         |

| 1       | VIP        |
| 10      | Standard   |
| 13      | Premium    |
+---------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| week_of_month | membership  | total_amount |
+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1             | Premium     | 1126         |
| 1             | VIP         | 0            |
| 2             | Premium     | 0            |
| 2             | VIP         | 7473         |
| 3             | Premium     | 0            |
| 3             | VIP         | 0            |
| 4             | Premium     | 5117         |
| 4             | VIP         | 14933        |
+---------------+-------------+--------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- During the first week of November 2023, a transaction occurred on  
    Friday, 2023-11-03, by a Premium member amounting to $1,126. No  
    transactions were made by VIP members on this day, resulting in a value  
    of 0.  
    
- For the second week of November 2023, there was a transaction on  
    Friday, 2023-11-10, and it was made by a VIP member, amounting to  
    $7,473. Since there were no purchases by Premium members that Friday,  
    the output shows 0 for Premium members.  
    
- Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, no transactions  
    by Premium or VIP members occurred on Friday, 2023-11-17, which shows 0  
    for both categories in this week.  
    
- In the fourth week of November 2023, transactions occurred on  
    Friday, 2023-11-24, involving one Premium member purchase of $5,117 and  
    VIP member purchases totaling $14,933 ($9,692 from one and $5,241 from  
    another).  
    

**Note:** The output table is ordered by week_of_month and membership in ascending order.

  

Let me solve this SQL problem step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the problem  
We need to calculate total spending by Premium and VIP members on each Friday of November 2023. We need to show all Fridays, even those without purchases (with 0 values). The results should be ordered by week of month and membership type.  

Step 2: Identify the Fridays in November 2023  
First, let's identify all Fridays in November 2023:  

```SQL
WITH fridays AS (
    SELECT '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
)
```

Explanation: This creates a temporary table with all the Fridays in November 2023, along with their corresponding week number.

Step 3: Create a cross join between membership types and Fridays

```SQL
WITH fridays AS (
    SELECT '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
),
membership_fridays AS (
    SELECT
        f.week_of_month,
        m.membership,
        f.friday_date
    FROM
        (SELECT 'Premium' AS membership UNION ALL SELECT 'VIP') m
    CROSS JOIN
        fridays f
)
```

Explanation: This creates a base table with all combinations of Friday dates and Premium/VIP membership types, which we'll need to ensure we have rows for all Fridays even if there were no purchases.

Step 4: Join with purchases and users to get spending data  
Let's build the full query:  

Let me explain this SQL solution step by step:

Step 1: Identify all Fridays in November 2023

```SQL
WITH fridays AS (
    SELECT '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
)
```

Explanation: We create a temporary table listing all Fridays in November 2023 with their corresponding week numbers. This ensures we have all Fridays, even those without purchases.

Step 2: Create combinations of membership types and Fridays

```SQL
membership_fridays AS (
    SELECT
        f.week_of_month,
        m.membership,
        f.friday_date
    FROM
        (SELECT 'Premium' AS membership UNION ALL SELECT 'VIP') m
    CROSS JOIN
        fridays f
)
```

Explanation: This creates all possible combinations of membership types ('Premium' and 'VIP') with each Friday. The CROSS JOIN ensures we have a row for each membership type on each Friday, which is essential for showing zeros when there are no purchases.

Step 3: Calculate purchases made on Fridays by Premium and VIP members

```SQL
friday_purchases AS (
    SELECT
        u.membership,
        p.purchase_date,
        SUM(p.amount_spend) AS total_spend
    FROM
        Purchases p
    JOIN
        Users u ON p.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE
        u.membership IN ('Premium', 'VIP')
        AND p.purchase_date IN (
            SELECT friday_date FROM fridays
        )
    GROUP BY
        u.membership, p.purchase_date
)
```

Explanation: This query:

- Joins the Purchases table with the Users table to get membership information
- Filters for only Premium and VIP members
- Filters for purchases made only on the Fridays we identified
- Groups by membership and purchase date to sum up all spending

Step 4: Combine all information and handle missing data

```SQL
SELECT
    mf.week_of_month,
    mf.membership,
    COALESCE(fp.total_spend, 0) AS total_amount
FROM
    membership_fridays mf
LEFT JOIN
    friday_purchases fp
    ON mf.membership = fp.membership
    AND mf.friday_date = fp.purchase_date
ORDER BY
    mf.week_of_month,
    mf.membership;
```

Explanation: This final query:

- Uses a LEFT JOIN to ensure we keep all combinations of Fridays and membership types
- Uses COALESCE to replace NULL values with 0 when there are no purchases
- Orders the results by week of month and then by membership type (alphabetically)

The solution ensures that:

1. All Fridays in November 2023 are represented
2. Both Premium and VIP memberships are included for each Friday
3. Zero values appear when there are no purchases
4. Results are properly ordered as required

This approach handles the challenge of showing all Fridays even when there are no purchases, which is often a tricky aspect of such reporting queries.

```SQL
WITH fridays AS (
    SELECT '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
),
membership_fridays AS (
    SELECT 
        f.week_of_month,
        m.membership,
        f.friday_date
    FROM 
        (SELECT 'Premium' AS membership UNION ALL SELECT 'VIP') m
    CROSS JOIN 
        fridays f
),
friday_purchases AS (
    SELECT 
        u.membership,
        p.purchase_date,
        SUM(p.amount_spend) AS total_spend
    FROM 
        Purchases p
    JOIN 
        Users u ON p.user_id = u.user_id
    WHERE 
        u.membership IN ('Premium', 'VIP')
        AND p.purchase_date IN (
            SELECT friday_date FROM fridays
        )
    GROUP BY 
        u.membership, p.purchase_date
)

SELECT 
    mf.week_of_month,
    mf.membership,
    COALESCE(fp.total_spend, 0) AS total_amount
FROM 
    membership_fridays mf
LEFT JOIN 
    friday_purchases fp 
    ON mf.membership = fp.membership 
    AND mf.friday_date = fp.purchase_date
ORDER BY 
    mf.week_of_month, 
    mf.membership;
```
