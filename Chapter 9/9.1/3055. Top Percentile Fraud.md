**Description**

Table: `Fraud`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| policy_id   | int     |
| state       | varchar |
| fraud_score | int     |
+-------------+---------+
policy_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains policy id, state, and fraud score.
```

The Leetcode Insurance Corp has developed an ML-driven **predictive model** to detect the **likelihood** of fraudulent claims. Consequently, they allocate their most seasoned claim adjusters to address the top `5%` of **claims flagged** by this model.

Write a solution to find the top `5` **percentile** of claims from **each state**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `state` _in **ascending** order,_ `fraud_score` _in **descending** order, and_ `policy_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Fraud table:
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| policy_id | state      | fraud_score |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 1         | California | 0.92        |
| 2         | California | 0.68        |
| 3         | California | 0.17        |
| 4         | New York   | 0.94        |
| 5         | New York   | 0.81        |
| 6         | New York   | 0.77        |
| 7         | Texas      | 0.98        |
| 8         | Texas      | 0.97        |
| 9         | Texas      | 0.96        |
| 10        | Florida    | 0.97        |
| 11        | Florida    | 0.98        |
| 12        | Florida    | 0.78        |
| 13        | Florida    | 0.88        |
| 14        | Florida    | 0.66        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
Output:
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| policy_id | state      | fraud_score |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 1         | California | 0.92        |
| 11        | Florida    | 0.98        |
| 4         | New York   | 0.94        |
| 7         | Texas      | 0.98        |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
Explanation
- For the state of California, only policy ID 1, with a fraud score of 0.92, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state.
- For the state of Florida, only policy ID 11, with a fraud score of 0.98, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state.
- For the state of New York, only policy ID 4, with a fraud score of 0.94, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state.
- For the state of Texas, only policy ID 7, with a fraud score of 0.98, falls within the top 5 percentile for this state.
Output table is ordered by state in ascending order, fraud score in descending order, and policy ID in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

To solve this, we must select the **top 5 percentile** of fraud scores **per state**. This requires a **ranking window function** along with filtering based on **percentile threshold**.

### âœ… SQL Query (Using `PERCENT_RANK`)

```SQL
WITH RankedFraud AS (
  SELECT
    policy_id,
    state,
    fraud_score,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY state
      ORDER BY fraud_score DESC
    ) AS fraud_percentile
  FROM Fraud
)
SELECT
  policy_id,
  state,
  fraud_score
FROM RankedFraud
WHERE fraud_percentile <= 0.05
ORDER BY state ASC, fraud_score DESC, policy_id ASC;
```

### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:

- `**PERCENT_RANK()**` computes the relative standing of a row within a state.
- We partition the data by `state` to evaluate rankings **per state**.
- Order descending by `fraud_score` to get highest scores at the top.
- Filter to retain only rows where `fraud_percentile <= 0.05` (top 5%).
- Order final results by:
    1. `state` ascending,
    2. `fraud_score` descending,
    3. `policy_id` ascending.

---

### âœ… Alternative (Using `NTILE(20)`)

If your SQL engine does not support `PERCENT_RANK()`:

```SQL
WITH Binned AS (
  SELECT
    policy_id,
    state,
    fraud_score,
    NTILE(20) OVER (
      PARTITION BY state
      ORDER BY fraud_score DESC
    ) AS bucket
  FROM Fraud
)
SELECT
  policy_id,
  state,
  fraud_score
FROM Binned
WHERE bucket = 1
ORDER BY state ASC, fraud_score DESC, policy_id ASC;
```

- `NTILE(20)` divides each state's data into 20 equal buckets (each = 5%).
- The top 5% will fall into `bucket = 1`.

Do you need percentile-based filtering for other thresholds too (e.g., top 10%, bottom 25%)?
