**Description**

Table: `employees`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| emp_id           | int     |
| salary           | int     |
| dept             | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
emp_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about an employee including their ID, salary, and department.
```

Write a solution to find the employees who earn the **second-highest salary** in each department. If **multiple employees have the second-highest salary**, **include all employees** with **that salary**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `emp_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

employees table:

```Plain
+--------+--------+-----------+
| emp_id | salary | dept      |
+--------+--------+-----------+
| 1      | 70000  | Sales     |
| 2      | 80000  | Sales     |
| 3      | 80000  | Sales     |
| 4      | 90000  | Sales     |
| 5      | 55000  | IT        |
| 6      | 65000  | IT        |
| 7      | 65000  | IT        |
| 8      | 50000  | Marketing |
| 9      | 55000  | Marketing |
| 10     | 55000  | HR        |
+--------+--------+-----------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+--------+-----------+
| emp_id | dept      |
+--------+-----------+
| 2      | Sales     |
| 3      | Sales     |
| 5      | IT        |
| 8      | Marketing |
+--------+-----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Sales Department**:
    
    ```Swift
    
    	Thinking Pattern
    	
    	Highest salary is 90000 (emp_id: 4)
    	Second-highest salary is 80000 (emp_id: 2, 3)
    	Both employees with salary 80000 are included
    
    
    IT Department:
    	Highest salary is 65000 (emp_id: 6, 7)
    	Second-highest salary is 55000 (emp_id: 5)
    	Only emp_id 5 is included as they have the second-highest salary
    
    
    Marketing Department:
    	Highest salary is 55000 (emp_id: 9)
    	Second-highest salary is 50000 (emp_id: 8)
    	Employee 8&nbsp;is included
    
    
    HR Department:
    	Only has one employee
    	Not included in the result as it has fewer than 2 employees
    ```

Let's break down this problem step by step:  

1. We need to ==**find employees who earn the second-highest salary in each department**==.
2. If multiple employees have the second-highest salary, we need to include all of them.
3. The result should be ordered by emp_id in ==ascending order==.
4. ==Departments with only one salary level should be excluded== (since they don't have a "second-highest").

To solve this, I'll need to:

1. Identify the ==distinct salary levels== in each department
2. ==Rank these salary levels== within each department (in descending order)
3. Select employees whose salary corresponds to the second rank
4. Ensure departments with only one salary level are excluded

Let me think about the most efficient approach. ==I could use window functions to rank salaries within each department, then filter for the second rank==. However, there's a complication: if two employees have the same salary, they should get the same rank. This means I need to use the ==DENSE_RANK()== function rather than RANK() to ensure consecutive ranking without gaps.

Here's my step-by-step approach:

1. First, I'll use DENSE_RANK() to assign a rank to each salary within a department (sorted in descending order): M

```SQL
SELECT emp_id, salary, dept,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
FROM employees
```

1. Then, I'll filter to keep only the employees whose salary rank is 2 (the second-highest):

```SQL
SELECT emp_id, dept
FROM (
    SELECT emp_id, salary, dept,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2
```

1. Finally, I'll order the results by emp_id in ascending order:

```SQL
SELECT emp_id, dept
FROM (
    SELECT emp_id, salary, dept,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2
ORDER BY emp_id ASC
```

Let me trace through the example data to verify this approach:

Sales Department:

- emp_id 4: salary 90000, rank 1
- emp_id 2, 3: salary 80000, rank 2 (both included)
- emp_id 1: salary 70000, rank 3

IT Department:

- emp_id 6, 7: salary 65000, rank 1
- emp_id 5: salary 55000, rank 2 (included)

Marketing Department:

- emp_id 9: salary 55000, rank 1
- emp_id 8: salary 50000, rank 2 (included)

HR Department:

- emp_id 10: salary 55000, rank 1 (not included as there's no second-highest salary)

So our expected output should be:

```Plain
+--------+-----------+
| emp_id | dept      |
+--------+-----------+
| 2      | Sales     |
| 3      | Sales     |
| 5      | IT        |
| 8      | Marketing |
+--------+-----------+
```

This matches the example output, so my solution should be correct.

I want to double-check one edge case: what if a department has two employees with the same salary? In that case, they would both get rank 1, and there would be no rank 2. This department would correctly be excluded from our results, which is what we want.

I think the solution is correct. Let me finalize it:

  

```SQL
SELECT emp_id, dept
FROM (
    SELECT 
        emp_id, 
        dept,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank = 2
ORDER BY emp_id ASC;
```

This problem asks us to find employees with the second-highest salary in each department, including all employees if multiple have the same second-highest salary. Let me explain my approach:

1. First, I need to rank salaries within each department. For this ranking task, I chose to use the `DENSE_RANK()` window function because:
    - It assigns the same rank to employees with identical salaries
    - It ensures consecutive ranks without gaps (unlike `RANK()` which would skip numbers)
    - This behavior is perfect for identifying the "second-highest" salary even when multiple employees share the highest salary
2. The core of my solution is a subquery that:
    - Groups employees by department (using `PARTITION BY dept`)
    - Ranks salaries in descending order within each department (using `ORDER BY salary DESC`)
    - Assigns a dense rank to each salary level
3. In the outer query, I:
    - Filter to include only employees with `salary_rank = 2` (the second-highest salary in their department)
    - Order the results by `emp_id` in ascending order as required

Let's trace through the example data to verify:

- **Sales Department**:
    - Salary 90000 (emp_id 4) → rank 1
    - Salary 80000 (emp_id 2, 3) → rank 2 ✓
    - Salary 70000 (emp_id 1) → rank 3
- **IT Department**:
    - Salary 65000 (emp_id 6, 7) → rank 1
    - Salary 55000 (emp_id 5) → rank 2 ✓
- **Marketing Department**:
    - Salary 55000 (emp_id 9) → rank 1
    - Salary 50000 (emp_id 8) → rank 2 ✓
- **HR Department**:
    - Only has one employee with one salary → no rank 2, so excluded

The query elegantly handles all the requirements, including:

- Finding the second-highest salary in each department
- Including all employees who share that second-highest salary
- Automatically excluding departments that don't have a second-highest salary
- Ordering the results by employee ID as specified

  

## Alternative Solution With CTE

# SQL Solution for Second-Highest Salary by Department

To solve this problem, I'll first create the `employees` table and insert the sample data. Then I'll write a query to find employees with the second-highest salary in each department.

## Create Table and Insert Data

```SQL
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    salary INT,
    dept VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, salary, dept) VALUES
(1, 70000, 'Sales'),
(2, 80000, 'Sales'),
(3, 80000, 'Sales'),
(4, 90000, 'Sales'),
(5, 55000, 'IT'),
(6, 65000, 'IT'),
(7, 65000, 'IT'),
(8, 50000, 'Marketing'),
(9, 55000, 'Marketing'),
(10, 55000, 'HR');
```

## Query to Find Second-Highest Salary by Department

```SQL
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        dept,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
    FROM
        employees
)
SELECT
    emp_id,
    dept
FROM
    RankedSalaries
WHERE
    salary_rank = 2
ORDER BY
    emp_id ASC;
```

## Explanation:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `RankedSalaries` CTE assigns a rank to each employee's salary within their department using `DENSE_RANK()`. This function handles ties correctly by giving the same rank to employees with identical salaries.
2. **Filtering**: In the main query, we select only employees whose salary rank is 2 (second-highest) in their department.
3. **Sorting**: The results are ordered by `emp_id` in ascending order as requested.
4. **Handling Ties**: If multiple employees have the second-highest salary (like in the Sales and IT departments), all of them will be included in the results.

The output matches the example provided, showing employees with the second-highest salary in each department.
