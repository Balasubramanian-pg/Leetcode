**Description**

Table: `Flights`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| flight_id   | int  |
| capacity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
flight_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains flight id and its capacity.
```

Table: `Passengers`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| flight_id    | int  |
+--------------+------+
passenger_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains passenger id and flight id.
```

Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a  
passenger books a ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats  
available on the flight, the passenger ticket will be **confirmed**. However, the passenger will be on a **waitlist** if the flight is already at full capacity.

Write a solution to report the number of passengers who  
successfully booked a flight (got a seat) and the number of passengers  
who are on the waitlist for each flight.  

Return the result table ordered by `flight_id` in **ascending** _**order**._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
- Flight 1 has a capacity of 2. As there are 3 passengers who have booked tickets, only 2 passengers can get a seat. Therefore, 2 passengers are successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2. Since there are exactly 2 passengers who booked tickets, everyone can secure a seat. As a result, 2 passengers successfully booked their seats and there are no passengers on the waitlist.
- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1. As there are 2 passengers who have booked tickets, only 1 passenger can get a seat. Therefore, 1 passenger is successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to figure out for each flight how many passengers actually got a seat (booked) and how many ended up on the waitlist. We know a flight has a certain `capacity`, and passengers get seats in some unspecified order (implied by the problem structure, we can assume it's related to how they appear in the `Passengers` table, or simply that the first `capacity` passengers are booked). Anyone beyond the capacity is waitlisted.

We have two tables: `Flights` (with `flight_id` and `capacity`) and `Passengers` (with `passenger_id` and `flight_id`).

Step 1: We need to know how many passengers are booked on _each_ flight. We can count the passengers from the `Passengers` table, grouping by `flight_id`.

```SQL
SELECT
    flight_id,
    COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
FROM Passengers
GROUP BY flight_id;
-- This gives us the total number of passengers who registered for each flight.
```

Explanation: We group the `Passengers` table by `flight_id` and count the number of `passenger_id`s in each group. This gives us the total number of passengers who _attempted_ to book a flight, per flight.

Step 2: Now we need to bring in the `capacity` information from the `Flights` table and combine it with the total passenger count we just calculated. We'll use a Common Table Expression (CTE) for the passenger counts and then join it with `Flights`. It's important to use a `LEFT JOIN` starting from `Flights` to make sure we include flights that might have 0 passengers registered (although the example doesn't show this scenario, it's robust practice).

```SQL
WITH PassengerCounts AS (
    SELECT
        flight_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
    FROM Passengers
    GROUP BY flight_id
)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    f.capacity,
    pc.total_passengers
FROM Flights f
LEFT JOIN PassengerCounts pc ON f.flight_id = pc.flight_id;
-- This joins the flight capacity with the total number of passengers for each flight.
-- Flights with no passengers will show NULL for total_passengers.
```

Explanation: We create a CTE `PassengerCounts` with the result from Step 1. Then, we select from the `Flights` table (aliased `f`) and `LEFT JOIN` it with `PassengerCounts` (aliased `pc`) on `flight_id`. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all flights from the `Flights` table are included in the result, even if they have no passengers listed in the `Passengers` table (in which case `pc.total_passengers` will be `NULL`). We also include `capacity` and `total_passengers` to see how they compare.

Step 3: Now we can calculate the number of booked passengers. The number of booked passengers for a flight is the smaller value between the flight's `capacity` and the `total_passengers` for that flight. We need to handle the case where a flight has 0 passengers (where `total_passengers` is `NULL`); `COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)` helps here. We can use the `LEAST()` or `MIN()` function (depending on the specific SQL dialect) to find the smaller of the two values.

```SQL
WITH PassengerCounts AS (
    SELECT
        flight_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
    FROM Passengers
    GROUP BY flight_id
)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    f.capacity,
    pc.total_passengers, -- Keep for now to illustrate
    -- Booked passengers is the minimum of capacity or total passengers
    LEAST(f.capacity, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)) AS booked_cnt
FROM Flights f
LEFT JOIN PassengerCounts pc ON f.flight_id = pc.flight_id;
-- This adds the calculated number of booked passengers, considering capacity limits.
```

Explanation: We add a new column `booked_cnt`. `COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)` gets the total passengers, treating `NULL` (for flights with no passengers) as 0. `LEAST(f.capacity, ...)` then compares the flight's capacity with the (coalesced) total passengers and selects the smaller value. This is the number of passengers who could get a seat.

Step 4: Next, we calculate the number of waitlisted passengers. The waitlisted passengers are anyone who registered but didn't get a seat. This is the difference between the `total_passengers` and the `booked_cnt`. If this difference is negative (which can happen if capacity is higher than total passengers, but waitlist count can't be negative), the waitlist count is 0. We can use the `GREATEST()` or `MAX()` function to ensure the waitlist count is not less than zero.

```SQL
WITH PassengerCounts AS (
    SELECT
        flight_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
    FROM Passengers
    GROUP BY flight_id
)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    f.capacity, -- Not needed in final output, but helpful for understanding
    pc.total_passengers, -- Not needed in final output
    LEAST(f.capacity, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)) AS booked_cnt,
    -- Waitlisted passengers is total passengers minus booked passengers, minimum 0
    GREATEST(0, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0) - LEAST(f.capacity, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0))) AS waitlist_cnt
    -- A simpler way: GREATEST(0, total_passengers - capacity)
FROM Flights f
LEFT JOIN PassengerCounts pc ON f.flight_id = pc.flight_id;
-- This adds the calculated number of waitlisted passengers.
```

Explanation: We add the `waitlist_cnt` column. We calculate the difference between `COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)` and the already calculated `booked_cnt`. `GREATEST(0, ...)` ensures that if this difference is negative (meaning capacity was higher than passengers), the waitlist count is reported as 0 instead of a negative number. An equivalent and often simpler calculation for waitlisted is `GREATEST(0, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0) - f.capacity)`. Let's use the simpler one in the final query.

Step 5: Finally, select only the required columns (`flight_id`, `booked_cnt`, `waitlist_cnt`) and order the result by `flight_id` ascendingly.

```SQL
WITH PassengerCounts AS (
    SELECT
        flight_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
    FROM Passengers
    GROUP BY flight_id
)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    LEAST(f.capacity, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)) AS booked_cnt,
    GREATEST(0, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0) - f.capacity) AS waitlist_cnt
FROM Flights f
LEFT JOIN PassengerCounts pc ON f.flight_id = pc.flight_id
ORDER BY f.flight_id ASC;
-- This selects the final required columns and orders the result.
```

Explanation: We select the `flight_id`, the calculated `booked_cnt`, and the calculated `waitlist_cnt`. We use `ORDER BY f.flight_id ASC` to sort the final results by flight ID from smallest to largest.

This query correctly calculates booked and waitlisted passengers for each flight, handling cases with fewer passengers than capacity and flights with no passengers, and orders the result as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH PassengerCounts AS (
    SELECT
        flight_id,
        COUNT(passenger_id) AS total_passengers
    FROM Passengers
    GROUP BY flight_id
)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    LEAST(f.capacity, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0)) AS booked_cnt,
    GREATEST(0, COALESCE(pc.total_passengers, 0) - f.capacity) AS waitlist_cnt
FROM Flights f
LEFT JOIN PassengerCounts pc ON f.flight_id = pc.flight_id
ORDER BY f.flight_id ASC;
