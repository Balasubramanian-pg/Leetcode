**Description**

Table: `Buses`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
bus_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the LeetCode station.
No two buses will arrive at the same time.
```

Table: `Passengers`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
passenger_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the LeetCode station.
```

Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at time `tbus` and a passenger arrived at time `tpassenger` where `tpassenger <= tbus` and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.

Write a solution to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by `bus_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Buses table:
+--------+--------------+
| bus_id | arrival_time |
+--------+--------------+
| 1      | 2            |
| 2      | 4            |
| 3      | 7            |
+--------+--------------+
Passengers table:
+--------------+--------------+
| passenger_id | arrival_time |
+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | 1            |
| 12           | 5            |
| 13           | 6            |
| 14           | 7            |
+--------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------+----------------+
| bus_id | passengers_cnt |
+--------+----------------+
| 1      | 1              |
| 2      | 0              |
| 3      | 3              |
+--------+----------------+
Explanation:
- Passenger 11 arrives at time 1.
- Bus 1 arrives at time 2 and collects passenger 11.

- Bus 2 arrives at time 4 and does not collect any passengers.

- Passenger 12 arrives at time 5.
- Passenger 13 arrives at time 6.
- Passenger 14 arrives at time 7.
- Bus 3 arrives at time 7 and collects passengers 12, 13, and 14.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining the logic clearly along the way.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Determine how many passengers each bus picks up
2. A passenger can use a bus if they arrived at the station before or at the same time as the bus
3. A passenger can only use the first available bus after they arrive
4. Return the count of passengers per bus, sorted by bus_id

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Identify which bus each passenger uses

First, we need to determine which bus each passenger will take. A passenger will take the earliest bus that arrives at or after their arrival time.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.passenger_id,
    MIN(b.bus_id) AS bus_id
FROM
    Passengers p,
    Buses b
WHERE
    p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
GROUP BY
    p.passenger_id;
```

Explanation: This query joins passengers with buses where the passenger arrives before or at the same time as the bus. We use MIN(bus_id) to get the earliest bus (assuming bus_id correlates with arrival time), and GROUP BY passenger_id to ensure each passenger is assigned to exactly one bus.

## Step 2: Count passengers per bus

Now, we can count how many passengers use each bus.

```SQL
SELECT
    b.bus_id,
    COUNT(p.passenger_id) AS passengers_cnt
FROM
    Buses b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        MIN(b.bus_id) AS bus_id
    FROM
        Passengers p,
        Buses b
    WHERE
        p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    GROUP BY
        p.passenger_id
) AS passenger_buses ON b.bus_id = passenger_buses.bus_id
GROUP BY
    b.bus_id
ORDER BY
    b.bus_id;
```

Explanation: We use the previous query as a subquery to match passengers to their buses. Then we LEFT JOIN this with the Buses table to ensure all buses are included, even those with no passengers. Finally, we count passengers per bus and order by bus_id.

## Step 3: Refine the solution to handle the issue of arrival time

There's a subtle issue in the previous approach. We're using MIN(bus_id) to get the earliest bus, but we should really be using the bus with the minimum arrival_time. Let's correct that:

```SQL
WITH PassengerBuses AS (
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        FIRST_VALUE(b.bus_id) OVER (
            PARTITION BY p.passenger_id
            ORDER BY b.arrival_time, b.bus_id
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
        ) AS bus_id
    FROM
        Passengers p
    JOIN
        Buses b ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
)

SELECT
    b.bus_id,
    COUNT(pb.passenger_id) AS passengers_cnt
FROM
    Buses b
LEFT JOIN
    PassengerBuses pb ON b.bus_id = pb.bus_id
GROUP BY
    b.bus_id
ORDER BY
    b.bus_id;
```

Explanation: We use a window function to get the earliest bus for each passenger, then count as before.

## Final Solution:

Let's simplify using another approach that's more intuitive:

```SQL
WITH RankedBuses AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        arrival_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS bus_rank
    FROM
        Buses
),
PassengerBusAssignment AS (
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        MIN(b.bus_rank) AS bus_rank
    FROM
        Passengers p
    JOIN
        RankedBuses b ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    GROUP BY
        p.passenger_id
)

SELECT
    b.bus_id,
    COUNT(pba.passenger_id) AS passengers_cnt
FROM
    RankedBuses b
LEFT JOIN
    PassengerBusAssignment pba ON b.bus_rank = pba.bus_rank
GROUP BY
    b.bus_id
ORDER BY
    b.bus_id;
```

This query:

1. First ranks the buses by arrival time
2. Assigns each passenger to the earliest available bus (with the lowest rank)
3. Counts passengers per bus using a LEFT JOIN to ensure all buses appear in the result
4. Orders the results by bus_id as required

The approach resolves the issue where multiple buses might arrive at the same time (though the problem states this won't happen) and ensures each passenger takes the earliest possible bus.
