Table: `Queue`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| person_name | varchar |
| weight      | int     |
| turn        | int     |
+-------------+---------+
person_id column contains unique values.
This table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.
The person_id and turn columns will contain all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the number of rows in the table.
turn determines the order of which the people will board the bus, where turn=1 denotes the first person to board and turn=n denotes the last person to board.
weight is the weight of the person in kilograms.
```

There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus. However, the bus has a weight limit of `1000` **kilograms**, so there may be some people who cannot board.

Write a solution to find the `person_name` of the **last person**  
that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit. The test  
cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the  
weight limit.  

**Note** that _only one_ person can board the bus at any given turn.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Queue table:
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |
| 3         | Alex        | 350    | 2    |
| 6         | John Cena   | 400    | 3    |
| 1         | Winston     | 500    | 6    |
| 2         | Marie       | 200    | 4    |
+-----------+-------------+--------+------+
Output:
+-------------+
| person_name |
+-------------+
| John Cena   |
+-------------+
Explanation: The folowing table is ordered by the turn for simplicity.
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| Turn | ID | Name      | Weight | Total Weight |
+------+----+-----------+--------+--------------+
| 1    | 5  | Alice     | 250    | 250          |
| 2    | 3  | Alex      | 350    | 600          |
| 3    | 6  | John Cena | 400    | 1000         | (last person to board)
| 4    | 2  | Marie     | 200    | 1200         | (cannot board)
| 5    | 4  | Bob       | 175    | ___          |
| 6    | 1  | Winston   | 500    | ___          |

# Solution to Find the Last Person to Fit on the Bus

To solve this problem, I need to determine the last person who can board the bus without exceeding the 1000 kg weight limit, considering the boarding order specified by the `turn` column.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
WITH CumulativeWeight AS (
    SELECT
        person_name,
        turn,
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS running_total
    FROM
        Queue
)
SELECT
    person_name
FROM
    CumulativeWeight
WHERE
    running_total <= 1000
ORDER BY
    turn DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Explanation

1. **Cumulative Weight Calculation**:
    - The CTE `CumulativeWeight` calculates the running total of weights as people board the bus in turn order
    - `SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn)` computes the cumulative sum of weights
2. **Filtering Valid Boarders**:
    - We select only rows where the running total is ≤ 1000 kg (people who can board without exceeding the limit)
3. **Finding the Last Valid Person**:
    - We order the valid boarders by turn in descending order
    - `LIMIT 1` gives us the last person who could board without exceeding the limit

For the example data:

- Alice (turn 1): 250 kg total
- Alex (turn 2): 600 kg total (250 + 350)
- John Cena (turn 3): 1000 kg total (600 + 400) → This is the last valid boarder
- Marie (turn 4): Would be 1200 kg (exceeds limit)
- The remaining people aren't considered since we already exceeded the limit

The output correctly identifies John Cena as the last person who could board without exceeding the 1000 kg limit.
