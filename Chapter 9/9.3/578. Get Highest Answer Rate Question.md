**Description**

Table: `SurveyLog`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| action      | ENUM |
| question_id | int  |
| answer_id   | int  |
| q_num       | int  |
| timestamp   | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type: "show", "answer", or "skip".
Each row of this table indicates the user with ID = id has taken an action with the question question_id at time timestamp.
If the action taken by the user is "answer", answer_id will contain the id of that answer, otherwise, it will be null.
q_num is the numeral order of the question in the current session.
```

The **answer rate** for a question is the number of times a user answered the question by the number of times a user showed the question.

Write a solution to report the question that has the highest **answer rate**. If multiple questions have the same maximum **answer rate**, report the question with the smallest `question_id`.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
SurveyLog table:
+----+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| id | action | question_id | answer_id | q_num | timestamp |
+----+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| 5  | show   | 285         | null      | 1     | 123       |
| 5  | answer | 285         | 124124    | 1     | 124       |
| 5  | show   | 369         | null      | 2     | 125       |
| 5  | skip   | 369         | null      | 2     | 126       |
+----+--------+-------------+-----------+-------+-----------+
Output:
+------------+
| survey_log |
+------------+
| 285        |
+------------+
Explanation:
Question 285 was showed 1 time and answered 1 time. The answer rate of question 285 is 1.0
Question 369 was showed 1 time and was not answered. The answer rate of question 369 is 0.0
Question 285 has the highest answer rate.
```

### **Approach 1: Group By with Conditional Aggregation**

**Goal**: Calculate the answer rate for each question and select the one with the highest rate (smallest ID in case of ties).

### Steps:

1. **Group by Question ID**:
    
    - For each `question_id`, compute:
        - `total_answers`: Count of rows where `action = 'answer'`.
        - `total_shows`: Count of rows where `action = 'show'`.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        question_id AS survey_log
    FROM SurveyLog
    GROUP BY question_id;
    ```
    
2. **Calculate Answer Rate and Order**:
    
    - Use `SUM(action = 'answer')` and `SUM(action = 'show')` to compute the answer rate.
    - Sort by `answer_rate DESC` (highest first) and `question_id ASC` (smallest ID first in ties).
    - Select the top result with `LIMIT 1`.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        question_id AS survey_log
    FROM SurveyLog
    GROUP BY question_id
    ORDER BY
        SUM(action = 'answer') / SUM(action = 'show') DESC,
        question_id
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `SUM(action = 'answer')` counts the number of "answer" actions per question.
- `SUM(action = 'show')` counts the number of "show" actions per question.
- The division of these sums gives the answer rate.
- Ordering ensures the highest rate (and smallest ID in ties) is selected.

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
SELECT
    question_id AS survey_log
FROM SurveyLog
GROUP BY question_id
ORDER BY
    SUM(action = 'answer') / SUM(action = 'show') DESC,
    question_id
LIMIT 1;
```

**Explanation of Results**:

- **Example Input**:
    - Question 285: 1 answer / 1 show = 1.0.
    - Question 369: 0 answers / 1 show = 0.0.
- The query correctly selects question 285 as it has the highest answer rate.
