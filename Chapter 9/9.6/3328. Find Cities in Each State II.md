**Description**

Table: `cities`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(state, city) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.
```

Write a solution to find **all the cities** in **each state** and analyze them based on the following requirements:

- Combine all cities into a **comma-separated** string for each state.
- Only include states that have **at least** `3` cities.
- Only include states where **at least one city** starts with the **same letter as the state name**.

Return _the result table ordered by the count of matching-letter cities in **descending** order_ _and then by state name in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

cities table:

```Plain
+--------------+---------------+
| state        | city          |
+--------------+---------------+
| New York     | New York City |
| New York     | Newark        |
| New York     | Buffalo       |
| New York     | Rochester     |
| California   | San Francisco |
| California   | Sacramento    |
| California   | San Diego     |
| California   | Los Angeles   |
| Texas        | Tyler         |
| Texas        | Temple        |
| Texas        | Taylor        |
| Texas        | Dallas        |
| Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
| Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
| Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |
+--------------+---------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                     |
| Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                     |
| New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                     |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Pennsylvania**:
    
    ```Plain
    <ul>
    	<li>Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement)</li>
    	<li>All 3 cities start with &#39;P&#39; (same as state)</li>
    	<li>matching_letter_count = 3</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Texas</strong>:
    <ul>
    	<li>Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)</li>
    	<li>3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with &#39;T&#39; (same as state)</li>
    	<li>matching_letter_count = 3</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>New York</strong>:
    <ul>
    	<li>Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)</li>
    	<li>2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with &#39;N&#39; (same as state)</li>
    	<li>matching_letter_count = 2</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>California</strong> is not included in the output because:
    <ul>
    	<li>Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)</li>
    	<li>No cities start with &#39;C&#39; (doesn&#39;t meet the matching letter requirement)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    ```
    

**Note:**

- Results are ordered by matching_letter_count in descending order
- When matching_letter_count is the same (Texas and New York both have 2), they are ordered by state name alphabetically
- Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically

<Inner Monologue>  
Let me analyze this problem step by step:  

We have a table called `cities` with state and city columns. We need to:

1. Group cities by state
2. Only include states that have at least 3 cities
3. Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state name
4. For each qualifying state, we need to:
    - List all its cities as a comma-separated string (ordered alphabetically)
    - Count how many cities start with the same letter as the state name
5. Order the results by:
    - Count of matching-letter cities (descending)
    - State name (ascending)

Let's break this down into steps:

First, I need to count cities per state and filter states with at least 3 cities:

```SQL
SELECT state, COUNT(*) as city_count
FROM cities
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
```

Next, I need to identify cities that start with the same letter as their state:

```SQL
SELECT state, city,
       CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_matching
FROM cities
```

Then, I need to combine these queries to get states that have at least one matching city:

```SQL
SELECT state,
       COUNT(*) as city_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as matching_count
FROM cities
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 AND
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 1
```

Now, I need to generate the comma-separated city list for each qualifying state. I'll use the GROUP_CONCAT function in MySQL (or similar functions in other database systems):

```SQL
SELECT state,
       GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city SEPARATOR ', ') as cities,
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as matching_letter_count
FROM cities
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 AND
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 1
ORDER BY matching_letter_count DESC, state ASC
```

Wait, I need to be careful about the case sensitivity. Let me check if the example uses case-sensitive or case-insensitive matching:

For Pennsylvania, cities Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown all start with 'P', same as the state - that's 3 matches.  
For Texas, cities Taylor, Temple, Tyler start with 'T', same as the state - that's 3 matches.  
For New York, cities Newark, New York City start with 'N', same as the state - that's 2 matches.  

It seems the matching is case-insensitive since we're comparing the first letters without regard to case (e.g., 'P'/'p', 'T'/'t', 'N'/'n'). So the solution above using LOWER() for the comparison should work.

Let me verify the expected output once more:

1. Pennsylvania has 3 cities, all starting with 'P' = 3 matches
2. Texas has 4 cities, 3 starting with 'T' = 3 matches
3. New York has 4 cities, 2 starting with 'N' = 2 matches
4. California has 4 cities, 0 starting with 'C' = 0 matches (excluded)

The output also shows that the cities within each state are listed in alphabetical order, and the results are sorted by matching_letter_count DESC, then state ASC.

One more detail: the problem statement notes that "Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically", which means we need to ensure our GROUP_CONCAT function orders cities alphabetically.

Let me finalize the solution:

For MySQL:

```SQL
SELECT state,
       GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city SEPARATOR ', ') as cities,
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as matching_letter_count
FROM cities
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 AND
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 1
ORDER BY matching_letter_count DESC, state ASC
```

For SQL Server or PostgreSQL (which use STRING_AGG instead of GROUP_CONCAT):

```SQL
SELECT state,
       STRING_AGG(city, ', ' ORDER BY city) as cities,
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as matching_letter_count
FROM cities
GROUP BY state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 AND
       SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 1
ORDER BY matching_letter_count DESC, state ASC
```

But let me double-check if the desired function exists in MySQL. I believe MySQL uses GROUP_CONCAT, PostgreSQL uses STRING_AGG, and SQL Server uses STRING_AGG (in newer versions) or XML PATH techniques. Since the problem doesn't specify a database system, I'll assume it's MySQL as that's common for LeetCode problems.

The statement says to use MySQL flavor unless specified, so I'll go with the GROUP_CONCAT version.

```SQL
SELECT 
    state, 
    GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matching_letter_count
FROM 
    cities
GROUP BY 
    state
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) >= 3 
    AND SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= 1
ORDER BY 
    matching_letter_count DESC, 
    state ASC;
```

Let me walk through my solution to this problem:

This query analyzes cities by state with specific filtering and formatting requirements. Here's how I approached it:

1. **Core Logic - Letter Matching**:  
    I used a  
    `CASE` statement to check if the first letter of each city matches the first letter of its state:
    
    ```SQL
    CASE WHEN LOWER(LEFT(city, 1)) = LOWER(LEFT(state, 1)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    ```
    
    This performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both first letters to lowercase before comparing.
    
2. **Aggregation Functions**:
    - `GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city SEPARATOR ', ')` creates an alphabetically ordered, comma-separated list of cities for each state.
    - `SUM(CASE WHEN...)` counts how many cities start with the same letter as their state.
    - `COUNT(*)` (used in HAVING) counts total cities per state.
3. **Filtering with HAVING**:  
    The query applies two critical filtering conditions:  
    - `COUNT(*) >= 3`: Only include states with at least 3 cities.
    - `SUM(CASE WHEN...) >= 1`: Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state.
4. **Sorting the Results**:
    - Primary sort: `matching_letter_count DESC` (states with more matching cities appear first)
    - Secondary sort: `state ASC` (alphabetical order when matching counts are equal)

The example trace validates our approach:

- Pennsylvania: All 3 cities (Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown) start with 'P' → matching_letter_count = 3
- Texas: 3 of 4 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with 'T' → matching_letter_count = 3
- New York: 2 of 4 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' → matching_letter_count = 2
- California: Has 4 cities but none start with 'C', so it's excluded from results

This solution efficiently handles all requirements in a single query with appropriate grouping, filtering, and sorting.
