**Description**

Table: `Activities`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| activity_id   | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| activity_type | enum    |
| time_spent    | decimal |
+---------------+---------+
activity_id is column of unique values for this table.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) type of ('send', 'open').
This table contains activity id, user id, activity type and time spent.
```

Table: `Age`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| age_bucket  | enum |
+-------------+------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
age_bucket is an ENUM (category) type of ('21-25', '26-30', '31-35').
This table contains user id and age group.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **percentage** of the total time spent on **sending** and **opening snaps** for **each age group**. Precentage should be **rounded** to `2` decimal places.

Return _the result table in **any** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activities table:
+-------------+---------+---------------+------------+
| activity_id | user_id | activity_type | time_spent |
+-------------+---------+---------------+------------+
| 7274        | 123     | open          | 4.50       |
| 2425        | 123     | send          | 3.50       |
| 1413        | 456     | send          | 5.67       |
| 2536        | 456     | open          | 3.00       |
| 8564        | 456     | send          | 8.24       |
| 5235        | 789     | send          | 6.24       |
| 4251        | 123     | open          | 1.25       |
| 1435        | 789     | open          | 5.25       |
+-------------+---------+---------------+------------+
Age table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | age_bucket |
+---------+------------+
| 123     | 31-35      |
| 789     | 21-25      |
| 456     | 26-30      |
+---------+------------+
Output:
+------------+-----------+-----------+
| age_bucket | send_perc | open_perc |
+------------+-----------+-----------+
| 31-35      | 37.84     | 62.16     |
| 26-30      | 82.26     | 17.74     |
| 21-25      | 54.31     | 45.69     |
+------------+-----------+-----------+
Explanation:
For age group 31-35:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 123.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 3.50, and the time spent on opening snaps is 4.50 + 1.25 = 5.75.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 3.50 + 5.75 = 9.25.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (3.50 / 9.25) * 100 = 37.84, and the opening snap percentage will be (5.75 / 9.25) * 100 = 62.16.
For age group 26-30:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 456.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 5.67 + 8.24 = 13.91, and the time spent on opening snaps is 3.00.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 13.91 + 3.00 = 16.91.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (13.91 / 16.91) * 100 = 82.26, and the opening snap percentage will be (3.00 / 16.91) * 100 = 17.74.
For age group 21-25:
  - There is only one user belonging to this group with the user ID 789.
  - The total time spent on sending snaps by this user is 6.24, and the time spent on opening snaps is 5.25.
  - The overall time spent by this user is 6.24 + 5.25 = 11.49.
  - Therefore, the sending snap percentage will be (6.24 / 11.49) * 100 = 54.31, and the opening snap percentage will be (5.25 / 11.49) * 100 = 45.69.
All percentages in output table rounded to the two decimal places.
```

## Solutions

### Step-by-Step SQL Solution

We are asked to compute the percentage of time spent on **send** and **open** activities for each **age group**, using the `Activities` and `Age` tables.

---

### Step 1: Join the Tables

We need to join `Activities` with `Age` using `user_id` to access `age_bucket` for each activity.

```SQL
SELECT
    A.age_bucket,
    AC.activity_type,
    AC.time_spent
FROM Activities AC
JOIN Age A
  ON AC.user_id = A.user_id
```

---

### Step 2: Aggregate Time Spent Per Activity Type per Age Group

We sum the time spent grouped by `age_bucket` and `activity_type`.

```SQL
SELECT
    A.age_bucket,
    AC.activity_type,
    SUM(AC.time_spent) AS total_time
FROM Activities AC
JOIN Age A
  ON AC.user_id = A.user_id
GROUP BY A.age_bucket, AC.activity_type
```

---

### Step 3: Pivot the Table to Separate Send and Open Time

We now pivot the data using `CASE WHEN` to get `send_time` and `open_time` per age bucket.

```SQL
SELECT
    age_bucket,
    SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_time,
    SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_time
FROM Activities AC
JOIN Age A
  ON AC.user_id = A.user_id
GROUP BY age_bucket
```

---

### Step 4: Calculate Percentages and Round

Finally, compute the percentages and round to 2 decimal places.

```SQL
SELECT
    age_bucket,
    ROUND(send_time * 100.0 / (send_time + open_time), 2) AS send_perc,
    ROUND(open_time * 100.0 / (send_time + open_time), 2) AS open_perc
FROM (
    SELECT
        age_bucket,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_time,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_time
    FROM Activities AC
    JOIN Age A
      ON AC.user_id = A.user_id
    GROUP BY age_bucket
) AS t
```

---

### Final Answer

```SQL
SELECT
    age_bucket,
    ROUND(send_time * 100.0 / (send_time + open_time), 2) AS send_perc,
    ROUND(open_time * 100.0 / (send_time + open_time), 2) AS open_perc
FROM (
    SELECT
        age_bucket,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_time,
        SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_time
    FROM Activities AC
    JOIN Age A
      ON AC.user_id = A.user_id
    GROUP BY age_bucket
) AS t
```

Would you like me to prepare a similar query using a CTE or window function variant for performance tuning or readability?
