**Description**

Table: `Cinema`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
```

Write a solution to find the **length** of **longest consecutive sequence** of **available** seats in the cinema.

Note:

- There will always be **at most one** longest consecutive sequence.
- If there are **multiple** consecutive sequences with the **same length**, include all of them in the output.

Return _the result table **ordered** by_ `first_seat_id` _**in ascending order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Cinema table:

```Plain
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
| first_seat_id   | last_seat_id   | consecutive_seats_len |
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
| 3               | 5              | 3                     |
+-----------------+----------------+-----------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Longest consecutive sequence of available seats starts from seat 3 and ends at seat 5 with a length of 3.

Output table is ordered by first_seat_id in ascending order.

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Using Window Function**

First, we find all the vacant seats, and then group the seats. The grouping is based on the seat number minus its ranking. In this way, consecutive vacant seats will be grouped together. Then we find the minimum seat number, maximum seat number, and length of consecutive seats in each group. Finally, we find the group with the longest length of consecutive seats, and output the minimum seat number, maximum seat number, and length of consecutive seats in this group.

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the problem  
We need to find the longest consecutive sequence of free seats in a cinema. If there are multiple sequences with the same maximum length, we should include all of them, ordered by the first seat ID in ascending order.  

Step 2: Identifying consecutive sequences  
The key challenge is to identify consecutive sequences of free seats. Let's explore a common technique for this:  

Let me explain this SQL solution step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
We need to find the longest consecutive sequence of available seats in a cinema. If there are multiple sequences tied for the longest length, we should include all of them, ordered by the first seat ID.  

Step 2: Identifying Consecutive Sequences

```SQL
WITH free_seats AS (
    SELECT
        seat_id,
        seat_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY seat_id) AS grp
    FROM
        Cinema
    WHERE
        free = 1
)
```

Explanation: This is the most clever part of the solution. We're using a technique to identify consecutive sequences:

- We filter to include only free seats (where free = 1)
- We calculate a group identifier using seat_id minus its row number
- When seats are consecutive, the difference between seat_id and row number will be constant
- This constant difference becomes the group identifier

For example, if seats 3, 4, and 5 are free:

- Seat 3 would have row number 1, so group = 3-1 = 2
- Seat 4 would have row number 2, so group = 4-2 = 2
- Seat 5 would have row number 3, so group = 5-3 = 2  
    All these consecutive seats have the same group value (2), which allows us to group them together.  
    

Step 3: Grouping Consecutive Seats

```SQL
seat_groups AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(seat_id) AS first_seat_id,
        MAX(seat_id) AS last_seat_id,
        COUNT(*) AS consecutive_seats_len
    FROM
        free_seats
    GROUP BY
        grp
)
```

Explanation: For each group (sequence of consecutive free seats):

- MIN(seat_id) gives us the first seat in the sequence
- MAX(seat_id) gives us the last seat in the sequence
- COUNT(*) gives us the length of the sequence
- We GROUP BY the group identifier we calculated in the previous step

Step 4: Finding the Maximum Length

```SQL
max_consecutive AS (
    SELECT
        MAX(consecutive_seats_len) AS max_len
    FROM
        seat_groups
)
```

Explanation: This simple query finds the maximum length among all consecutive sequences.

Step 5: Retrieving Results

```SQL
SELECT
    first_seat_id,
    last_seat_id,
    consecutive_seats_len
FROM
    seat_groups
WHERE
    consecutive_seats_len = (SELECT max_len FROM max_consecutive)
ORDER BY
    first_seat_id;
```

Explanation: The final query:

- Selects all sequences that have the maximum length
- Orders them by first_seat_id as required
- Returns first_seat_id, last_seat_id, and consecutive_seats_len for each sequence

The key insight in this solution is the technique to identify consecutive sequences using the difference between the seat_id and its row number. When this difference is the same for multiple rows, those rows represent consecutive seats.

Using our example data:

- Seats 1, 3, 4, and 5 are free (seat 2 is occupied)
- There are two sequences: [1] and [3,4,5]
- The longest sequence is [3,4,5] with length 3
- So the output shows first_seat_id = 3, last_seat_id = 5, consecutive_seats_len = 3

This solution efficiently handles the challenge of identifying consecutive sequences and finds the longest one(s) as required.

```SQL
WITH free_seats AS (
    SELECT 
        seat_id,
        seat_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY seat_id) AS grp
    FROM 
        Cinema
    WHERE 
        free = 1
),
seat_groups AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(seat_id) AS first_seat_id,
        MAX(seat_id) AS last_seat_id,
        COUNT(*) AS consecutive_seats_len
    FROM 
        free_seats
    GROUP BY 
        grp
),
max_consecutive AS (
    SELECT 
        MAX(consecutive_seats_len) AS max_len
    FROM 
        seat_groups
)

SELECT 
    first_seat_id,
    last_seat_id,
    consecutive_seats_len
FROM 
    seat_groups
WHERE 
    consecutive_seats_len = (SELECT max_len FROM max_consecutive)
ORDER BY 
    first_seat_id;
```
