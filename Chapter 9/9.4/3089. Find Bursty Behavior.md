**Description**

Table: `Posts`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| post_id     | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
| post_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains post_id, user_id, and post_date.
```

Write a solution to find users who demonstrate **bursty behavior** in their posting patterns during February `2024`. **Bursty behavior** is defined as **any** period of **7 consecutive** days where a user's posting frequency is **at least twice** to their **average** weekly posting frequency for February `2024`.

**Note:** Only include the dates from February `1` to February `28` in your analysis, which means you should count February as having exactly `4` weeks.

Return _the result table orderd by_ `user_id` _in_ **ascending** _order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Posts table:

```Plain
+---------+---------+------------+
| post_id | user_id | post_date  |
+---------+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1       | 2024-02-27 |
| 2       | 5       | 2024-02-06 |
| 3       | 3       | 2024-02-25 |
| 4       | 3       | 2024-02-14 |
| 5       | 3       | 2024-02-06 |
| 6       | 2       | 2024-02-25 |
+---------+---------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| user_id | max_7day_posts | avg_weekly_posts |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| 1       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 2       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 5       | 1              | 0.2500           |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **User 1:** Made only 1 post in February, resulting in an average of 0.25 posts per week and a max of 1 post in any 7-day period.
- **User 2:** Also made just 1 post, with the same average and max 7-day posting frequency as User 1.
- **User 5:** Like Users 1 and 2, User 5 made only 1 post throughout February, leading to the same average and max 7-day posting metrics.
- **User 3:** Although User 3 made more posts than the  
    others (3 posts), they did not reach twice the average weekly posts in  
    their consecutive 7-day window, so they are not listed in the output.  
    

**Note:** Output table is ordered by user_id in ascending order.

  

To find users who demonstrate bursty behavior in their posting patterns during February 2024, we need to:

1. **Calculate the weekly posting frequency** for each user during February 2024.
2. **Identify any 7-day period** where the user’s posting frequency is at least twice their average weekly posting frequency.
3. **Return the user_id, their max 7-day posting frequency, and their average weekly posting frequency** for February 2024.

### **Steps to Approach**:

1. **Filter the Posts**: Only consider posts made in February 2024 (i.e., from `2024-02-01` to `2024-02-28`).
2. **Calculate Average Weekly Posting Frequency**: Since February has 4 weeks, divide the total number of posts made by the user in February by 4 to get their average weekly posting frequency.
3. **Sliding Window for 7-day Periods**: For each user, calculate the number of posts they made in every 7-day period. For each user, track the maximum number of posts made in any such period.
4. **Check for Bursty Behavior**: A user demonstrates bursty behavior if any 7-day period has a posting frequency at least twice their average weekly frequency.
5. **Return the Required Data**: Output the user_id, their max 7-day posting frequency, and their average weekly posting frequency for the bursty behavior users.

### **SQL Query**:

```SQL
WITH WeeklyStats AS (
    -- Calculate total posts for each user in February
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) / 4.0 AS avg_weekly_posts  -- Divide by 4 since February has 4 weeks
    FROM Posts
    WHERE post_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28'
    GROUP BY user_id
),
Max7DayStats AS (
    -- Calculate the maximum number of posts in any 7-day period for each user
    SELECT
        p1.user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS max_7day_posts
    FROM Posts p1
    JOIN Posts p2
        ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
        AND p1.post_date BETWEEN p2.post_date AND DATE_ADD(p2.post_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY)
    WHERE p1.post_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28'
    GROUP BY p1.user_id, p2.post_date
),
BurstyUsers AS (
    -- Identify users whose max 7-day post count is at least twice their average weekly post count
    SELECT
        ws.user_id,
        MAX(ms.max_7day_posts) AS max_7day_posts,
        ws.avg_weekly_posts
    FROM WeeklyStats ws
    JOIN Max7DayStats ms
        ON ws.user_id = ms.user_id
    GROUP BY ws.user_id, ws.avg_weekly_posts
    HAVING MAX(ms.max_7day_posts) >= 2 * ws.avg_weekly_posts
)

-- Final result: Return the users with bursty behavior sorted by user_id
SELECT
    user_id,
    max_7day_posts,
    avg_weekly_posts
FROM BurstyUsers
ORDER BY user_id;
```

### **Explanation of the Query**:

1. **WeeklyStats**:
    - This CTE calculates the average number of posts per week for each user in February 2024. Since February has exactly 4 weeks, the total number of posts is divided by 4 to get the weekly average.
2. **Max7DayStats**:
    - This CTE calculates the maximum number of posts a user made in any 7-day period. This is achieved by joining the table with itself (`p1` and `p2`), where `p1` represents the current post and `p2` represents a post within the same 7-day window (from `p2.post_date` to `p2.post_date + 6 days`).
3. **BurstyUsers**:
    - This CTE checks if the user’s maximum post count in any 7-day period is at least twice their average weekly post count. It uses a `HAVING` clause to filter users who meet this condition.
4. **Final Selection**:
    - Finally, the result is selected from `BurstyUsers`, and it is sorted by `user_id` in ascending order, as required.

### **Example Walkthrough**:

Given the input:

```Plain
+---------+---------+------------+
| post_id | user_id | post_date  |
+---------+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1       | 2024-02-27 |
| 2       | 5       | 2024-02-06 |
| 3       | 3       | 2024-02-25 |
| 4       | 3       | 2024-02-14 |
| 5       | 3       | 2024-02-06 |
| 6       | 2       | 2024-02-25 |
+---------+---------+------------+
```

### **Step-by-Step**:

1. **WeeklyStats** will compute:
    - For user 1: Total posts = 1 post, avg_weekly_posts = 1 / 4 = 0.25.
    - For user 5: Total posts = 1 post, avg_weekly_posts = 1 / 4 = 0.25.
    - For user 3: Total posts = 3 posts, avg_weekly_posts = 3 / 4 = 0.75.
    - For user 2: Total posts = 1 post, avg_weekly_posts = 1 / 4 = 0.25.
2. **Max7DayStats** will calculate the max posts in any 7-day period for each user:
    - For user 1: max_7day_posts = 1.
    - For user 5: max_7day_posts = 1.
    - For user 3: max_7day_posts = 2.
    - For user 2: max_7day_posts = 1.
3. **BurstyUsers** will filter users where the max_7day_posts is at least twice their average weekly posts:
    - For user 1: 1 >= 2 * 0.25 (True, included).
    - For user 2: 1 >= 2 * 0.25 (True, included).
    - For user 5: 1 >= 2 * 0.25 (True, included).
    - For user 3: 2 >= 2 * 0.75 (False, excluded).

### **Final Output**:

```Plain
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| user_id | max_7day_posts | avg_weekly_posts |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
| 1       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 2       | 1              | 0.2500           |
| 5       | 1              | 0.2500           |
+---------+----------------+------------------+
```

This shows that users 1, 2, and 5 demonstrate bursty behavior, with their posting activity reaching at least twice their average weekly frequency in a 7-day period.
