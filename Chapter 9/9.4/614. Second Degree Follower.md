**Description**

Table: `Follow`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| followee    | varchar |
| follower    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(followee, follower) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.
There will not be a user following themself.
```

A **second-degree follower** is a user who:

- follows at least one user, and
- is followed by at least one user.

Write a solutionÂ to report the **second-degree users** and the number of their followers.

Return the result table **ordered** by `follower` **in alphabetical order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Markdown
Input:
Follow table:
+----------+----------+
| followee | follower |
+----------+----------+
| Alice    | Bob      |
| Bob      | Cena     |
| Bob      | Donald   |
| Donald   | Edward   |
+----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+-----+
| follower | num |
+----------+-----+
| Bob      | 2   |
| Donald   | 1   |
+----------+-----+
Explanation:
User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table.
User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.
User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the      result table.
```

### **Solution with CTE**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT f1.follower AS follower, f2.follower AS followee
        FROM
            Follow AS f1
            JOIN Follow AS f2 ON f1.follower = f2.followee
    )
SELECT follower, COUNT(DISTINCT followee) AS num
FROM T
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

### Solution without Self Join

To solve this problem, we need to find all second-degree followers and the number of their followers. A second-degree follower is defined as a user who follows at least one user (appears in the `follower` column) and is followed by at least one user (appears in the `followee` column).

### Approach

1. **Identify Second-Degree Followers**: These users must appear in both the `follower` column (indicating they follow someone) and the `followee` column (indicating they are followed by someone).
2. **Count Followers**: For each such user, count how many followers they have (i.e., the number of times they appear as `followee` in the table).
3. **Filter and Order Results**: Include only users who meet both criteria (follow at least one user and have at least one follower), then order the results alphabetically by the follower's name.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    followee AS follower,
    COUNT(*) AS num
FROM
    Follow
WHERE
    followee IN (SELECT follower FROM Follow)
GROUP BY
    followee
ORDER BY
    follower;
```

### Explanation

1. **Subquery for Valid Followers**: The subquery `(SELECT follower FROM Follow)` retrieves all distinct users who follow at least one other user. This ensures we consider only users who are followers.
2. **Filtering Followees**: The main query filters the `Follow` table to include only those `followee` entries that exist in the subquery result (i.e., users who are both followers and followees).
3. **Counting Followers**: The `COUNT(*)` function counts how many times each valid `followee` appears in the filtered result, which represents the number of followers they have.
4. **Grouping and Ordering**: Results are grouped by `followee` to aggregate counts per user and ordered alphabetically by `follower` (the alias for `followee`).

This approach efficiently identifies second-degree followers and their follower counts by leveraging subquery filtering and aggregation, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.

### Why Use `IN` in This Solution?

The `IN` method is used here to identify users who are **both followees and followers** (second-degree followers). Here's why it works well:

1. **Logical Requirement**: We need users who:
    - Appear in the `follower` column (they follow someone)
    - Appear in the `followee` column (they're followed by someone)
2. **Simple Implementation**:
    
    ```SQL
    WHERE followee IN (SELECT follower FROM Follow)
    ```
    
    This efficiently checks which followees are also in the list of all followers.
    
3. **Readability**: The `IN` clause clearly expresses the business logic of finding users who exist in both roles.

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Using** `**EXISTS**`:
    
    ```SQL
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Follow f WHERE f.follower = Follow.followee)
    ```
    
    - Often more efficient for large tables
    - Stops searching after finding first match
2. **Using** `**JOIN**`:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT f1.followee AS follower, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM Follow f1
    JOIN Follow f2 ON f1.followee = f2.follower
    GROUP BY f1.followee
    ORDER BY f1.followee
    ```
    
    - More complex but might be faster for certain database engines
    - Requires understanding the self-join

### Why `IN` is Appropriate Here

1. **Small Result Set**: The subquery `(SELECT follower FROM Follow)` returns a small list of distinct followers.
2. **Clear Intent**: The query clearly shows we're filtering followees who are also followers.
3. **Performance**: For this specific case with few rows, performance differences are negligible.

### When to Consider Alternatives

- For very large tables, `EXISTS` might perform better
- If you need additional filtering conditions, a `JOIN` might be more flexible
- If the list from the subquery is very large, `IN` might become inefficient

The `IN` method provides the perfect balance of simplicity and efficiency for this particular problem with the given dataset size.
