+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| name          | varchar |

Table: `MovieRating`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| movie_id      | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| rating        | int     |
| created_at    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(movie_id, user_id) is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
created_at is the user's review date.
```

Write a solution to:

- Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of  
    movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user  
    name.  
    
- Find the movie name with the **highest average** rating in `February 2020`. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Movies table:
+-------------+--------------+
| movie_id    |  title       |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | Avengers     |

Explanation:
Daniel and Monica have rated 3 movies ("Avengers", "Frozen 2" and "Joker") but Daniel is smaller lexicographically.
Frozen 2 and Joker have a rating average of 3.5 in February but Frozen 2 is smaller lexicographically.
```

# Solution for Movie Rating Analysis

To solve this problem, I'll address both requirements separately and then combine the results. Let's break it down step by step.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
(
    -- Find user who rated the most movies (lex smallest name for ties)
    SELECT u.name AS results
    FROM Users u
    JOIN MovieRating mr ON u.user_id = mr.user_id
    GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, u.name ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
UNION ALL
(
    -- Find movie with highest avg rating in Feb 2020 (lex smallest name for ties)
    SELECT m.title AS results
    FROM Movies m
    JOIN MovieRating mr ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
    WHERE mr.created_at BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
    GROUP BY m.movie_id, m.title
    ORDER BY AVG(mr.rating) DESC, m.title ASC
    LIMIT 1
);
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Part 1: User with Most Ratings

1. **Join Users with MovieRating**:
    - Connect users to their ratings using `user_id`
2. **Group by User**:
    - Count how many ratings each user has made
3. **Order Results**:
    - First by count (descending) to get users with most ratings
    - Then by name (ascending) to break ties lexicographically
4. **Limit to Top Result**:
    - Only return the top user meeting these criteria

### Part 2: Highest Rated Movie in February 2020

1. **Filter February 2020 Ratings**:
    - Use `BETWEEN` to only consider ratings from Feb 2020
2. **Join Movies with Filtered Ratings**:
    - Connect movies to their filtered ratings
3. **Group by Movie**:
    - Calculate average rating for each movie
4. **Order Results**:
    - First by average rating (descending) to get highest rated
    - Then by title (ascending) to break ties lexicographically
5. **Limit to Top Result**:
    - Only return the top movie meeting these criteria

### Combining Results

- Use `UNION ALL` to combine both queries into a single result set
- Each subquery returns exactly one row

## Example Walkthrough

For the given data:

**Users with most ratings**:

- Daniel: 3 ratings (Avengers, Frozen 2, Joker)
- Monica: 3 ratings (same movies)
- Both have 3 ratings, but "Daniel" comes before "Monica" alphabetically

**Highest rated in Feb 2020**:

- Frozen 2:
    - Ratings: 5 (from Daniel), 2 (from Monica)
    - Average: (5+2)/2 = 3.5
- Joker:
    - Ratings: 3 (from Daniel), 4 (from Monica)
    - Average: (3+4)/2 = 3.5
- Both have 3.5 average, but "Frozen 2" comes before "Joker" alphabetically

Final output correctly shows:

```Plain
Daniel
Frozen 2
```
