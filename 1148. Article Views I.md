Table: `Views`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date.
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
```

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 4    |
| 7    |
+------+
```

# Solution to Find Authors Who Viewed Their Own Articles

To solve this problem, I need to find all distinct author IDs where the author viewed at least one of their own articles (where author_id = viewer_id). The results should be sorted by ID in ascending order.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id ASC;
```

## Explanation

1. `SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id`:
    - We select the author_id column and rename it as 'id' in the output
    - DISTINCT ensures we don't get duplicate author IDs (important since the table may have duplicate rows)
2. `FROM Views`:
    - Specifies we're querying the Views table
3. `WHERE author_id = viewer_id`:
    - This is the key condition that identifies when an author viewed their own article
    - The problem note confirms that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person
4. `ORDER BY author_id ASC`:
    - Sorts the results by author_id in ascending order as required

For the given example:

- Author 7 viewed their own article (article_id 2 with viewer_id 7)
- Author 4 viewed their own article (article_id 3 with viewer_id 4) twice (but DISTINCT removes the duplicate)
- The other authors didn't view their own articles

The output correctly lists IDs 4 and 7 in ascending order.
