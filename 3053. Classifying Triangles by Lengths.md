**Description**

Table: `Triangles`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| A           | int  |
| B           | int  |
| C           | int  |
+-------------+------+
(A, B, C) is the primary key for this table.
Each row include the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.
```

Write a query to find the type of **triangle**. Output one of the following for each row:

- **Equilateral**: It's a triangle with `3` sides of equal length.
- **Isosceles**: It's a triangle with `2` sides of equal length.
- **Scalene**: It's a triangle with `3` sides of differing lengths.
- **Not A Triangle:** The given values of `A`, `B`, and `C` don't form a triangle.

Return _the result table in **any order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Triangles table:
+----+----+----+
| A  | B  | C  |
+----+----+----+
| 20 | 20 | 23 |
| 20 | 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 21 | 22 |
| 13 | 14 | 30 |
+----+----+----+
Output:
+----------------+
| triangle_type  |
+----------------+
| Isosceles      |
| Equilateral    |
| Scalene        |
| Not A Triangle |
+----------------+
Explanation:
- Values in the first row from an Isosceles triangle, because A = B.
- Values in the second row from an Equilateral triangle, because A = B = C.
- Values in the third row from an Scalene triangle, because A != B != C.
- Values in the fourth row cannot form a triangle, because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.
```

To classify each triangle, we apply two principles:

---

### 1. **Triangle Inequality Rule**

A valid triangle must satisfy:

- `A + B > C`
- `A + C > B`
- `B + C > A`

If not satisfied → **Not A Triangle**

---

### 2. **Side Equality Check**

- All sides equal → **Equilateral**
- Two sides equal → **Isosceles**
- All sides different → **Scalene**

---

### ✅ Final SQL Query

```SQL
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
  END AS triangle_type
FROM Triangles;
```

---

### Why this works:

- The `CASE` block first eliminates invalid triangles.
- Then checks for all sides equal.
- Then checks for two sides equal.
- Falls through to scalene if none of the above match.

Would you like to extend this to include triangle area or angle classification next?
