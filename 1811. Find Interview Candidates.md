**Description**

Table: `Contests`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| contest_id   | int  |
| gold_medal   | int  |
| silver_medal | int  |
| bronze_medal | int  |
+--------------+------+
contest_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains the LeetCode contest ID and the user IDs of the gold, silver, and bronze medalists.
It is guaranteed that any consecutive contests have consecutive IDs and that no ID is skipped.
```

Table: `Users`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| mail        | varchar |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the users.
```

Write a solution to report the `name` and the `mail` of all **interview candidates**. A user is an **interview candidate** if **at least one** of these two conditions is true:

- The user won **any** medal in **three or more consecutive** contests.
- The user won the **gold** medal in **three or more different** contests (not necessarily consecutive).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Contests table:
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| contest_id | gold_medal | silver_medal | bronze_medal |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 190        | 1          | 5            | 2            |
| 191        | 2          | 3            | 5            |
| 192        | 5          | 2            | 3            |
| 193        | 1          | 3            | 5            |
| 194        | 4          | 5            | 2            |
| 195        | 4          | 2            | 1            |
| 196        | 1          | 5            | 2            |
+------------+------------+--------------+--------------+
Users table:
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| user_id | mail               | name  |
+---------+--------------------+-------+
| 1       | sarah@leetcode.com | Sarah |
| 2       | bob@leetcode.com   | Bob   |
| 3       | alice@leetcode.com | Alice |
| 4       | hercy@leetcode.com | Hercy |
| 5       | quarz@leetcode.com | Quarz |
+---------+--------------------+-------+
Output:
+-------+--------------------+
| name  | mail               |
+-------+--------------------+
| Sarah | sarah@leetcode.com |
| Bob   | bob@leetcode.com   |
| Alice | alice@leetcode.com |
| Quarz | quarz@leetcode.com |
+-------+--------------------+
Explanation:
Sarah won 3 gold medals (190, 193, and 196), so we include her in the result table.
Bob won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (190, 191, and 192), so we include him in the result table.
    - Note that he also won a medal in 3 other consecutive contests (194, 195, and 196).
Alice won a medal in 3 consecutive contests (191, 192, and 193), so we include her in the result table.
Quarz won a medal in 5 consecutive contests (190, 191, 192, 193, and 194), so we include them in the result table.
```

**Follow up:**

- What if the first condition changed to be "any medal in `n` **or more** consecutive contests"? How would you change your solution to get the interview candidates? Imagine that `n` is the parameter of a stored procedure.
- Some users may not participate in every contest but still perform  
    well in the ones they do. How would you change your solution to only  
    consider contests where the user **was a participant**? Suppose the registered users for each contest are given in another table.

## Solutions

I'll analyze this SQL problem and provide a step-by-step solution.

## Problem Understanding

The problem requires finding all "interview candidates" based on two conditions:

1. Users who won any medal (gold, silver, or bronze) in at least 3 consecutive contests
2. Users who won the gold medal in at least 3 different contests (not necessarily consecutive)

We need to query the `name` and `mail` of these users from the `Users` table.

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Start with a basic query structure

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    -- We'll build this subquery to find the qualifying user_ids
);
```

Explanation: We're setting up a basic query to select the name and mail from the Users table. We'll filter to include only users whose user_id appears in our subquery (which we'll develop next).

## Step 2: Identify users who won gold medals in at least 3 different contests

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT gold_medal
    FROM Contests
    GROUP BY gold_medal
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
);
```

Explanation: This subquery counts how many times each user appears in the gold_medal column across all contests. The HAVING clause filters to keep only users who won gold at least 3 times.

## Step 3: Prepare to identify users who won any medal in 3 consecutive contests

We need to find users who won any medal in three consecutive contests. This is more complex because we need to:

1. Convert the medal columns into rows
2. Check for consecutive contest participation

Let's first create a unified view of all medals:

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT gold_medal
    FROM Contests
    GROUP BY gold_medal
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3

    UNION

    -- Next we'll add the query for consecutive medals
);
```

Explanation: We're using UNION to combine our first condition (3+ gold medals) with our second condition (which we'll build next).

## Step 4: Create a query to find users with any medal in consecutive contests

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT gold_medal
    FROM Contests
    GROUP BY gold_medal
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3

    UNION

    SELECT user_id
    FROM (
        SELECT contest_id, gold_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
        UNION ALL
        SELECT contest_id, silver_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
        UNION ALL
        SELECT contest_id, bronze_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
    ) AS medals
    -- We'll add logic to check for consecutive contests next
);
```

Explanation: We've created a unified view of all medals by combining gold, silver, and bronze medals into a single column. This gives us a row for each (contest_id, user_id) combination where the user won any medal.

## Step 5: Add logic to check for consecutive contests

To find consecutive contests, we'll use window functions:

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    SELECT gold_medal
    FROM Contests
    GROUP BY gold_medal
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3

    UNION

    SELECT user_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            contest_id,
            contest_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY contest_id) AS grp
        FROM (
            SELECT contest_id, gold_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
            UNION ALL
            SELECT contest_id, silver_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
            UNION ALL
            SELECT contest_id, bronze_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
        ) AS medals
    ) AS consecutive_check
    GROUP BY user_id, grp
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
);
```

Explanation: The key insight here is that consecutive contests have consecutive IDs. By subtracting a row number from the contest_id, we create a grouping value that will be the same for consecutive contests. Then we count how many contests are in each group and check if any group has 3 or more contests.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE user_id IN (
    -- Users who won gold medal in at least 3 different contests
    SELECT gold_medal
    FROM Contests
    GROUP BY gold_medal
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3

    UNION

    -- Users who won any medal in 3 or more consecutive contests
    SELECT user_id
    FROM (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            contest_id,
            contest_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY contest_id) AS grp
        FROM (
            SELECT contest_id, gold_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
            UNION ALL
            SELECT contest_id, silver_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
            UNION ALL
            SELECT contest_id, bronze_medal AS user_id FROM Contests
        ) AS medals
    ) AS consecutive_check
    GROUP BY user_id, grp
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
);
```

This solution addresses both conditions:

1. The first part of the UNION identifies users who won gold medals in at least 3 different contests.
2. The second part identifies users who won any medal in at least 3 consecutive contests by using the difference between contest_id and row_number to identify consecutive sequences.

The final result gives us the name and mail of all users who satisfy either condition.
