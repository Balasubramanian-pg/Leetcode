**Description**

Table: `Salaries`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| emp_name    | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(emp_name, department) is the primary key (combination of unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains emp_name, department and salary. There will beat least one entry for the engineering and marketing departments.
```

Write a solution to calculate the difference between the **highest** salaries in the **marketing** and **engineering** `department`. Output the absolute difference in salaries.

Return _the result table._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Salaries table:
+----------+-------------+--------+
| emp_name | department  | salary |
+----------+-------------+--------+
| Kathy    | Engineering | 50000  |
| Roy      | Marketing   | 30000  |
| Charles  | Engineering | 45000  |
| Jack     | Engineering | 85000  |
| Benjamin | Marketing   | 34000  |
| Anthony  | Marketing   | 42000  |
| Edward   | Engineering | 102000 |
| Terry    | Engineering | 44000  |
| Evelyn   | Marketing   | 53000  |
| Arthur   | Engineering | 32000  |
+----------+-------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------------+
| salary_difference |
+-------------------+
| 49000             |
+-------------------+
Explanation:
- The Engineering and Marketing departments have the highest salaries of 102,000 and 53,000, respectively. Resulting in an absolute difference of 49,000.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the highest salary in the 'Marketing' department, the highest salary in the 'Engineering' department, and then calculate the absolute difference between these two amounts.

We will work with the `Salaries` table.

Step 1: We need to find the maximum salary for each of the two specific departments, 'Marketing' and 'Engineering'. We can do this in a single query by using conditional aggregation. This means we will use the `MAX()` function, but only consider the `salary` value for rows that match a specific department using a `CASE` statement.

```SQL
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN salary END) AS max_marketing_salary,
    MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Engineering' THEN salary END) AS max_engineering_salary
FROM Salaries;
-- This finds the highest salary within the Marketing department and the highest salary within the Engineering department.
```

Explanation: We select the maximum salary from the `Salaries` table twice.

- `MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN salary END)`: This expression looks at each row. If the `department` is 'Marketing', it considers the `salary` for the `MAX` function. If it's any other department, it considers `NULL`. The `MAX` function then finds the highest salary value among all the 'Marketing' salaries (ignoring the `NULL`s). We give this the temporary name `max_marketing_salary`.
- `MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Engineering' THEN salary END)`: This does the same thing but finds the highest salary only for the 'Engineering' department, named `max_engineering_salary`.  
    This query gives us two values: the highest salary in Marketing and the highest in Engineering.  
    

Step 2: The problem asks for the _absolute difference_ between these two maximum salaries. We can calculate this difference and then use the `ABS()` function to ensure the result is always positive.

```SQL
SELECT
    -- Calculate the absolute difference between the two maximum salaries
    ABS(MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN salary END) - MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Engineering' THEN salary END)) AS salary_difference
FROM Salaries;
-- This calculates the difference between the two max salaries and takes the absolute value.
```

Explanation: We take the two maximum values calculated in Step 1 (the highest marketing salary and the highest engineering salary), subtract one from the other, and then use the `ABS()` function to get the absolute value of the result (making it positive regardless of which department had the higher salary). We name the resulting column `salary_difference` as required.

This single query directly calculates the final needed value.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    ABS(MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Marketing' THEN salary END) - MAX(CASE WHEN department = 'Engineering' THEN salary END)) AS salary_difference
FROM Salaries;
```
