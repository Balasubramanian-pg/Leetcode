**Description**

Table: `Days`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| day         | date |
+-------------+------+
day is the column with unique values for this table.
```

Write a solution to convert each date in `Days` into a string formatted as `"day_name, month_name day, year"`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Days table:
+------------+
| day        |
+------------+
| 2022-04-12 |
| 2021-08-09 |
| 2020-06-26 |
+------------+
Output:
+-------------------------+
| day                     |
+-------------------------+
| Tuesday, April 12, 2022 |
| Monday, August 9, 2021  |
| Friday, June 26, 2020   |
+-------------------------+
Explanation: Please note that the output is case-sensitive.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to convert date values from the `Days` table into a specific string format:

- "day_name, month_name day, year"
- Example: "Tuesday, April 12, 2022"

We need to use SQL date formatting functions to achieve this.

## Step 1: Understand how to format dates in SQL

```SQL
SELECT day
FROM Days
```

Explanation: First, let's understand what we're working with. We have a table with a date column that we need to reformat.

## Step 2: Apply date formatting functions

```SQL
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(day, '%W, %M %d, %Y') AS day
FROM Days
```

Explanation: We use the DATE_FORMAT function with specific format specifiers:

- %W: Weekday name in full (Sunday, Monday, etc.)
- %M: Month name in full (January, February, etc.)
- %d: Day of the month as a numeric value (01-31)
- %Y: Year as a 4-digit number

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(day, '%W, %M %d, %Y') AS day
FROM Days
```

This solution:

1. Takes each date from the `Days` table
2. Uses the DATE_FORMAT function to convert it to the required string format
3. Returns the formatted string as 'day'

The format string '%W, %M %d, %Y' creates the exact output required:

- Weekday name (%W)
- Followed by a comma and space (", ")
- Month name (%M)
- Space followed by day of month (%d)
- Followed by a comma and space (", ")
- 4-digit year (%Y)

This will produce results like "Tuesday, April 12, 2022" as required.
