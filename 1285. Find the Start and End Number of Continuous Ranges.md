**Description**

Table: `Logs`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
log_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
```

Write a solution to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in the table `Logs`.

Return the result table ordered by `start_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation:
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing from the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.
```

I'll analyze this SQL problem step by step, providing a detailed explanation of the solution strategy.

## Problem Understanding

We need to find continuous ranges of log_id values in the Logs table. For example:

- If we have log_ids 1, 2, 3 - this is one continuous range (1-3)
- If we have log_ids 7, 8 - this is another continuous range (7-8)
- If we have a single log_id 10 - this is a range of just one number (10-10)

## Solution Strategy

To identify continuous ranges, we need to recognize where sequences start and end. A key insight is that for continuous numbers, the difference between the current number and its position in an ordered sequence will be constant.

For example, in a perfect sequence [1,2,3,4], the difference between each value and its position (1-based) is always 0:

- 1-1 = 0
- 2-2 = 0
- 3-3 = 0
- 4-4 = 0

But in a sequence with gaps like [1,2,3,7,8,10], these differences mark the start of new ranges:

- 1-1 = 0 (first range starts)
- 2-2 = 0 (same range continues)
- 3-3 = 0 (same range continues)
- 7-4 = 3 (new range starts)
- 8-5 = 3 (same range continues)
- 10-6 = 4 (new range starts)

## SQL Approach

Here's the solution using window functions:

```SQL
WITH RankedLogs AS (
    SELECT
        log_id,
        log_id - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY log_id) AS group_id
    FROM Logs
)
SELECT
    MIN(log_id) AS start_id,
    MAX(log_id) AS end_id
FROM RankedLogs
GROUP BY group_id
ORDER BY start_id;
```

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Window Function Analysis**:
    - `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY log_id)` assigns a sequential position to each log_id when ordered
    - `log_id - ROW_NUMBER()` calculates the difference which remains constant within a continuous range
    - This difference (group_id) changes only when there's a gap in the sequence
2. **Grouping Logic**:
    - By grouping on this difference, we collect all log_ids that belong to the same continuous range
    - For each group, the minimum log_id is the start of the range
    - The maximum log_id is the end of the range
3. **Example Walkthrough**:
    
    For the input [1,2,3,7,8,10]:
    
    |   |   |   |
    |---|---|---|
    |log_id|row_number|group_id (log_id - row_number)|
    |1|1|0|
    |2|2|0|
    |3|3|0|
    |7|4|3|
    |8|5|3|
    |10|6|4|
    
    After grouping by group_id:
    
    - Group 0: min=1, max=3 → (1,3)
    - Group 3: min=7, max=8 → (7,8)
    - Group 4: min=10, max=10 → (10,10)
4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single-number ranges (like 10) work correctly
    - The query handles all possible gaps correctly
    - The result is properly ordered by start_id as required

## Alternative Approaches

Another approach could use the LEAD function to identify gaps and self-joins:

```SQL
WITH Gaps AS (
    SELECT
        log_id,
        LEAD(log_id) OVER (ORDER BY log_id) AS next_id
    FROM Logs
),
StartPoints AS (
    SELECT log_id AS start_id
    FROM Logs
    WHERE log_id - 1 NOT IN (SELECT log_id FROM Logs)
),
EndPoints AS (
    SELECT log_id AS end_id
    FROM Logs
    WHERE log_id + 1 NOT IN (SELECT log_id FROM Logs)
)
SELECT s.start_id, e.end_id
FROM StartPoints s
JOIN EndPoints e ON s.start_id <= e.end_id
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Logs l
    WHERE l.log_id > s.start_id AND l.log_id < e.end_id
    AND l.log_id + 1 NOT IN (SELECT log_id FROM Logs)
    AND l.log_id - 1 NOT IN (SELECT log_id FROM Logs)
)
ORDER BY s.start_id;
```

However, this is more complex and less efficient than the window function approach.

The window function solution is elegant because it transforms a complex problem (finding ranges) into a simple task of identifying constant differences, which is perfectly suited for SQL's GROUP BY capabilities.
