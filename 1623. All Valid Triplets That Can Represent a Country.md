**Description**

Table: `SchoolA`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school A.
All student_name are distinct.
```

Table: `SchoolB`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school B.
All student_name are distinct.
```

Table: `SchoolC`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a student in school C.
All student_name are distinct.
```

There is a country with three schools, where each student is enrolled in **exactly one**  
school. The country is joining a competition and wants to select one  
student from each school to represent the country such that:  

- `member_A` is selected from `SchoolA`,
- `member_B` is selected from `SchoolB`,
- `member_C` is selected from `SchoolC`, and
- The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same  
    ID).  
    

Write a solution to find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
SchoolA table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
+------------+--------------+
SchoolB table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
+------------+--------------+
SchoolC table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 3          | Tom          |
| 2          | Jerry        |
| 10         | Alice        |
+------------+--------------+
Output:
+----------+----------+----------+
| member_A | member_B | member_C |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Alice    | Tom      | Jerry    |
| Bob      | Tom      | Alice    |
+----------+----------+----------+
Explanation:
Let us see all the possible triplets.
- (Alice, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Alice, Tom, Jerry) --> Valid triplet.
- (Alice, Tom, Alice) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same name.
- (Bob, Tom, Tom) --> Rejected because member_B and member_C have the same name and the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Jerry) --> Rejected because member_A and member_C have the same ID.
- (Bob, Tom, Alice) --> Valid triplet.
```

## Solutions

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you. Let me start by understanding what we need to do here.

## Problem Summary

We need to find all valid triplets of students (one from each school) to represent a country in a competition where:

1. The three students must come from three different schools (A, B, and C)
2. No two students can share the same name
3. No two students can share the same ID

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Start with a simple cross join of all three tables

```SQL
SELECT
    a.student_name AS member_A,
    b.student_name AS member_B,
    c.student_name AS member_C
FROM
    SchoolA a,
    SchoolB b,
    SchoolC c;
```

Explanation: This gets all possible combinations of students from the three schools. It creates a cartesian product, meaning every student from School A is paired with every student from School B and School C.

### Step 2: Add filters to ensure no students share the same name

```SQL
SELECT
    a.student_name AS member_A,
    b.student_name AS member_B,
    c.student_name AS member_C
FROM
    SchoolA a,
    SchoolB b,
    SchoolC c
WHERE
    a.student_name != b.student_name
    AND a.student_name != c.student_name
    AND b.student_name != c.student_name;
```

Explanation: We added WHERE conditions to ensure that no two students have the same name. We're comparing names between all pairs of schools.

### Step 3: Add additional filters to ensure no students share the same ID

```SQL
SELECT
    a.student_name AS member_A,
    b.student_name AS member_B,
    c.student_name AS member_C
FROM
    SchoolA a,
    SchoolB b,
    SchoolC c
WHERE
    -- No students share the same name
    a.student_name != b.student_name
    AND a.student_name != c.student_name
    AND b.student_name != c.student_name
    -- No students share the same ID
    AND a.student_id != b.student_id
    AND a.student_id != c.student_id
    AND b.student_id != c.student_id;
```

Explanation: Now we've added additional conditions to ensure no two students have the same ID. Combined with our previous conditions, this ensures that both names and IDs are unique across all three selected students.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    a.student_name AS member_A,
    b.student_name AS member_B,
    c.student_name AS member_C
FROM
    SchoolA a
    CROSS JOIN SchoolB b
    CROSS JOIN SchoolC c
WHERE
    -- No students share the same name
    a.student_name != b.student_name
    AND a.student_name != c.student_name
    AND b.student_name != c.student_name
    -- No students share the same ID
    AND a.student_id != b.student_id
    AND a.student_id != c.student_id
    AND b.student_id != c.student_id;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution with explicit CROSS JOIN syntax. It takes all possible combinations of students from the three schools and filters out any combination where two students share either the same name or the same ID. The result will be all valid triplets that could represent the country in the competition.
