Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.
```

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins  
other departments, they need to decide which department is their  
primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one  
department, their primary column is  
`'N'`.

Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary  
department. For employees who belong to one department, report their  
only department.  

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation:
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.

# Solution to Find Employees' Primary Departments

To solve this problem, I need to identify each employee's primary department, considering both the explicit primary flag and cases where employees only belong to one department.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'

UNION

SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1

ORDER BY employee_id;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **First Part (Explicit Primary Departments)**:
    - Select all records where `primary_flag = 'Y'`
    - This captures employees who have explicitly marked a primary department
2. **Second Part (Single-Department Employees)**:
    - Group by `employee_id` and filter for those with only one department (`COUNT(*) = 1`)
    - These employees automatically have their sole department as primary (even if marked 'N')
3. **Combine Results**:
    - Use `UNION` to combine both sets of results
    - `UNION` automatically removes duplicates (though none should exist here)
    - Order by `employee_id` for consistent output (though problem allows any order)

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data:

- Employee 1: Only department 1 (primary_flag='N') → included via second query
- Employee 2: Two departments, with department 1 marked 'Y' → included via first query
- Employee 3: Only department 3 (primary_flag='N') → included via second query
- Employee 4: Three departments, with department 3 marked 'Y' → included via first query

The solution correctly identifies:

- Employee 1: department 1
- Employee 2: department 1
- Employee 3: department 3
- Employee 4: department 3

The approach efficiently handles both cases (explicit primary flags and single-department employees) while avoiding duplicates.
