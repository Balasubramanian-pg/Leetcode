**Description**

Table: `Tasks`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| task_id        | int     |
| subtasks_count | int     |
+----------------+---------+
task_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that task_id was divided into subtasks_count subtasks labeled from 1 to subtasks_count.
It is guaranteed that 2 <= subtasks_count <= 20.
```

Table: `Executed`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| task_id       | int     |
| subtask_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(task_id, subtask_id) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that for the task task_id, the subtask with ID subtask_id was executed successfully.
It isguaranteed that subtask_id <= subtasks_count for each task_id.
```

Write a solutionÂ to report the IDs of the missing subtasks for each `task_id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Tasks table:
+---------+----------------+
| task_id | subtasks_count |
+---------+----------------+
| 1       | 3              |
| 2       | 2              |
| 3       | 4              |
+---------+----------------+
Executed table:
+---------+------------+
| task_id | subtask_id |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 3       | 2          |
| 3       | 3          |
| 3       | 4          |
+---------+------------+
Output:
+---------+------------+
| task_id | subtask_id |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1          |
| 1       | 3          |
| 2       | 1          |
| 2       | 2          |
+---------+------------+
Explanation:
Task 1 was divided into 3 subtasks (1, 2, 3). Only subtask 2 was executed successfully, so we include (1, 1) and (1, 3) in the answer.
Task 2 was divided into 2 subtasks (1, 2). No subtask was executed successfully, so we include (2, 1) and (2, 2) in the answer.
Task 3 was divided into 4 subtasks (1, 2, 3, 4). All of the subtasks were executed successfully.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to find all subtasks that haven't been executed for each task. Each task is divided into subtasks numbered 1 to subtasks_count, and we need to report the task_id and subtask_id for all missing subtask executions.

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Generate all possible subtasks for each task

First, we need to create a list of all subtasks that should exist for each task. We'll use a recursive common table expression (CTE) to generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to subtasks_count for each task.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE all_subtasks AS (
    SELECT
        task_id,
        1 AS subtask_id,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        Tasks

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        task_id,
        subtask_id + 1,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        all_subtasks
    WHERE
        subtask_id < subtasks_count
)
SELECT
    task_id,
    subtask_id
FROM
    all_subtasks;
```

Explanation: This recursive CTE starts with subtask_id = 1 for each task and recursively adds rows until it reaches subtasks_count. The result is a complete list of all task-subtask pairs that should exist.

### Step 2: Find the missing subtasks by using a LEFT JOIN with the Executed table

Now that we have all possible subtasks, we can use a LEFT JOIN with the Executed table to find the ones that haven't been executed.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE all_subtasks AS (
    SELECT
        task_id,
        1 AS subtask_id,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        Tasks

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        task_id,
        subtask_id + 1,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        all_subtasks
    WHERE
        subtask_id < subtasks_count
)
SELECT
    a.task_id,
    a.subtask_id
FROM
    all_subtasks a
LEFT JOIN
    Executed e ON a.task_id = e.task_id AND a.subtask_id = e.subtask_id
WHERE
    e.task_id IS NULL;
```

Explanation: We join our generated list of all subtasks with the Executed table. The WHERE clause with `e.task_id IS NULL` filters for rows where the subtask wasn't found in the Executed table, meaning it wasn't executed.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE all_subtasks AS (
    SELECT
        task_id,
        1 AS subtask_id,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        Tasks

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        task_id,
        subtask_id + 1,
        subtasks_count
    FROM
        all_subtasks
    WHERE
        subtask_id < subtasks_count
)
SELECT
    a.task_id,
    a.subtask_id
FROM
    all_subtasks a
LEFT JOIN
    Executed e ON a.task_id = e.task_id AND a.subtask_id = e.subtask_id
WHERE
    e.task_id IS NULL
ORDER BY
    a.task_id, a.subtask_id;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution. We use a recursive CTE to generate all task-subtask pairs that should exist, then LEFT JOIN with the Executed table to find pairs that don't have a corresponding execution record. The final ORDER BY clause is optional but helps present the results in a more readable format.
