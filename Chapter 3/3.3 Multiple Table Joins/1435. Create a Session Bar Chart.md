**Description**

Table: `Sessions`

```Plain
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| session_id          | int     |
| duration            | int     |
+---------------------+---------+
session_id is the column of unique values for this table.
duration is the time in seconds that a user has visited the application.
```

You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of `"[0-5>"`, `"[5-10>"`, "[10-15>", and `"15 minutes or more"` and count the number of sessions on it.

Write a solution to report the `(bin, total)`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 199           |
| 3           | 299           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+
Output:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+
Explanation:
For session_id 1, 2, and 3 have a duration greater or equal than 0 minutes and less than 5 minutes.
For session_id 4 has a duration greater or equal than 5 minutes and less than 10 minutes.
There is no session with a duration greater than or equal to 10 minutes and less than 15 minutes.
For session_id 5 has a duration greater than or equal to 15 minutes.
```

I'll write a solution to group session durations into specified time bins and count the number of sessions in each bin.

Looking at the problem:

1. We need to categorize session durations into 4 bins:
    - [0-5> minutes (less than 5 minutes or 300 seconds)
    - [5-10> minutes (between 5 and 10 minutes, or 300-599 seconds)
    - [10-15> minutes (between 10 and 15 minutes, or 600-899 seconds)
    - 15 or more minutes (900 seconds or more)
2. Then we need to count the number of sessions in each bin

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    '[0-5>' AS bin,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM
    Sessions
WHERE
    duration < 300

UNION

SELECT
    '[5-10>' AS bin,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM
    Sessions
WHERE
    duration >= 300 AND duration < 600

UNION

SELECT
    '[10-15>' AS bin,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM
    Sessions
WHERE
    duration >= 600 AND duration < 900

UNION

SELECT
    '15 or more' AS bin,
    COUNT(*) AS total
FROM
    Sessions
WHERE
    duration >= 900;
```

This solution:

1. Creates four separate queries, each counting sessions for a specific time bin
2. Combines the results using UNION
3. For each query:
    - Defines the bin label (e.g., '[0-5>')
    - Counts the number of sessions that fall into that bin's range
    - Uses appropriate WHERE clauses to filter by duration in seconds

Note that durations in the example are given in seconds, so I've converted the minute ranges:

- 5 minutes = 300 seconds
- 10 minutes = 600 seconds
- 15 minutes = 900 seconds

Based on the example data, we'd get:

- [0-5>: 3 sessions (IDs 1, 2, 3 with durations 30, 199, 299)
- [5-10>: 1 session (ID 4 with duration 580)
- [10-15>: 0 sessions
- 15 or more: 1 session (ID 5 with duration 1000)

Which matches the expected output.
