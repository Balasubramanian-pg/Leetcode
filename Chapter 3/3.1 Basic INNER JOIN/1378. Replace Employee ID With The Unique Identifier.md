Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
```

Table: `EmployeeUNI`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
```

Write a solution to show the **unique ID** of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show `null`.

Return the result table in **any** order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output:
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
Explanation:
Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.
```

To solve this problem, we need to retrieve the unique ID of each employee from the EmployeeUNI table. If an employee does not have a unique ID, we should display `null` instead. This can be achieved using a left join to ensure all employees are included in the result, even those without a unique ID.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Tables**: The Employees table contains all employees with their IDs and names. The EmployeeUNI table maps each employee's ID to a unique ID, if available.
2. **Left Join**: Use a left join to combine the Employees table with the EmployeeUNI table on the employee ID. This ensures that all employees from the Employees table are included, and their corresponding unique ID is fetched if it exists. If no unique ID exists, it will be `null`.
3. **Select Columns**: Select the unique ID from the EmployeeUNI table and the employee name from the Employees table.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT EU.unique_id, E.name
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI EU ON E.id = EU.id;
```

### Explanation

- **Left Join**: By left joining the Employees table with the EmployeeUNI table on the employee ID, we ensure that all employees are included in the result. If an employee does not have a corresponding entry in the EmployeeUNI table, the unique ID will be `null`.
- **Result Columns**: The result includes two columns: `unique_id` from the EmployeeUNI table and `name` from the Employees table. This ensures that each employee's name is displayed along with their unique ID, or `null` if they don't have one.

This approach efficiently combines the two tables and handles missing unique IDs gracefully by using a left join, ensuring all employees are included in the result.
