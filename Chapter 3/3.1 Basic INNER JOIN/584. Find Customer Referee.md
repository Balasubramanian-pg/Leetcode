Table: `Customer`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
```

Find the names of the customer that are **not referred by** the customer with `id = 2`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output:
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

# Finding Customers Not Referred by Customer ID 2

To solve this problem, I need to identify customers who were not referred by the customer with id = 2. This includes customers who were referred by someone else or not referred at all (referee_id is NULL).

## Approach

1. **Filter Condition**: We need to select customers where:
    - Their referee_id is NULL (not referred by anyone)
    - OR their referee_id is not equal to 2 (referred by someone else)
2. **Exclusion**: We should exclude customers who were specifically referred by customer id 2.
3. **Simple Selection**: Just select the customer names that meet our criteria.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2;
```

## Explanation

- The query selects the `name` column from the Customer table.
- The WHERE clause has two conditions joined with OR:
    - `referee_id IS NULL` - catches customers with no referrer
    - `referee_id != 2` - catches customers referred by someone other than id 2
- In the example:
    - Will, Jane, and Bill have NULL referee_ids
    - Zack was referred by id 1
    - Alex and Mark (referred by id 2) are excluded
- The result correctly shows all customers not referred by id 2.

This approach efficiently filters the customers using simple SQL conditions that handle both NULL values and specific ID exclusion.
