Table: `ActorDirector`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
```

Write a solution to find all the pairs `(actor_id, director_id)` where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.

# Finding Actor-Director Pairs with At Least Three Collaborations

To solve this problem, I need to identify all unique pairs of actors and directors who have worked together at least three times. This requires counting the number of collaborations between each actor-director pair and filtering for those with three or more occurrences.

## Approach

1. **Group by Actor and Director**: Group the records by both `actor_id` and `director_id` to count collaborations.
2. **Count Collaborations**: For each group, count the number of rows (collaborations).
3. **Filter Pairs**: Only include pairs where the count is 3 or more.
4. **Select Result**: Return just the actor_id and director_id columns for qualifying pairs.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT actor_id, director_id
FROM ActorDirector
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

## Explanation

- The query groups the ActorDirector table by both `actor_id` and `director_id` to consider each unique pair.
- The `HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3` clause filters these groups to only include pairs that appear 3 or more times in the table.
- In the example:
    - The pair (1,1) appears 3 times (timestamp 0,1,2)
    - All other pairs appear less than 3 times
- Therefore, only (1,1) is returned in the result.

This approach efficiently identifies frequent collaborators by leveraging SQL's grouping and aggregation functions, which are optimized for this type of operation. The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on the count condition.
