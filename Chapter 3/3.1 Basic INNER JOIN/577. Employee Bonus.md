Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| empId       | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| supervisor  | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
empId is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of an employee in addition to their salary and the id of their manager.
```

Table: `Bonus`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| empId       | int  |
| bonus       | int  |
+-------------+------+
empId is the column of unique values for this table.
empId is a foreign key (reference column) to empId from the Employee table.
Each row of this table contains the id of an employee and their respective bonus.
```

Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus **less than** `1000`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employee table:
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
| empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
| 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
Bonus table:
+-------+-------+
| empId | bonus |
+-------+-------+
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |
+-------+-------+
Output:
+------+-------+
| name | bonus |
+------+-------+
| Brad | null  |
| John | null  |
| Dan  | 500   |
+------+-------+
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to report the name and bonus amount of each employee where the bonus is less than 1000. Employees who do not have a bonus entry should also be included, as their bonus is effectively considered `null` and thus less than 1000.

### Approach

1. **Left Join**: Use a left join to combine the Employee table with the Bonus table on the employee ID (`empId`). This ensures that all employees from the Employee table are included, even if they do not have a corresponding entry in the Bonus table.
2. **Filter Condition**: After performing the left join, filter the results to include only those employees where the bonus is either less than 1000 or `null`. This is done using the condition `WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL`.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;
```

### Explanation

- **Left Join**: By using a left join between the Employee and Bonus tables, we ensure that all employees are included in the result set. If an employee does not have a corresponding entry in the Bonus table, the `bonus` column will be `null` for that employee.
- **Filter Condition**: The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those rows where the bonus is either less than 1000 or `null`. This ensures that employees without a bonus entry are included, as their `bonus` is considered `null` and thus meets the condition of being less than 1000.

This approach efficiently combines the tables and handles missing bonus entries by using a left join, ensuring all relevant employees are included in the result.
