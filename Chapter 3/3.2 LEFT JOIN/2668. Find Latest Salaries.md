**Description**

Table: `Salary`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| emp_id        | int     |
| firstname     | varchar |
| lastname      | varchar |
| salary        | varchar |
| department_id | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(emp_id, salary) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains employees details and their yearly salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information.
```

Write a solution to find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their `emp_id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `salary`, and `department_id`.

Return the result table ordered by `emp_id` in **ascending** order_._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

+--------+-----------+----------+--------+---------------+Explanation:
- emp_id 1 has two records with a salary of 110000, 106119 out of these 110000 is an updated salary (Assuming salary is increasing each year)
- emp_id 2 has two records with a salary of 128922, 130000 out of these 130000 is an updated salary.
- emp_id 3 has only one salary record so that is already an updated salary.
- emp_id 4 has two records with a salary of 162825, 170000 out of these 170000 is an updated salary.
- emp_id 5 has only one salary record so that is already an updated salary.
- emp_id 6 has two records with a salary of 79632, 90000 out of these 90000 is an updated salary.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the single most recent salary record for each employee. We know that salaries increase each year, so the record with the _highest_ salary for a given employee is the most current one. We need to show all details (`emp_id`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `salary`, `department_id`) for this highest salary record and order the final result by `emp_id`.

We will be working with the `Salary` table. Since an employee can appear multiple times with different salaries, we need a way to pick just one row (the one with the max salary) per employee.

Step 1: We'll start by selecting all the columns from the `Salary` table. We also need to figure out how to identify the highest salary for each employee. A common way to do this when dealing with groups (employees) and wanting to pick a specific row within each group based on some criteria (highest salary) is using window functions.

```SQL
SELECT
    emp_id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    salary,
    department_id
FROM Salary;
-- This just gets all the data from the table.
-- We haven't filtered or identified the current salary yet.
```

Explanation: This is the basic structure to select all the required columns from the `Salary` table.

Step 2: To find the row with the highest salary _for each employee_, we can use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function. We will partition (group) the data by `emp_id` and order the rows within each partition by `salary` in descending order (highest first). `ROW_NUMBER()` will then assign a rank starting from 1 to each row within the employee's group. The row with the highest salary will get rank 1.

```SQL
SELECT
    emp_id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    salary,
    department_id,
    -- Assign a row number within each employee group,
    -- ordered by salary from highest to lowest.
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
FROM Salary;
-- This adds a column 'rn' which is 1 for the highest salary record for each employee.
```

Explanation: We add a calculated column `rn` using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

- `PARTITION BY emp_id`: This divides the rows into separate groups, one for each unique `emp_id`.
- `ORDER BY salary DESC`: Inside each `emp_id` group, the rows are sorted by the `salary` column from largest to smallest.
- `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a sequential number (1, 2, 3, ...) to each row within the ordered partition. The row with the highest salary gets `rn = 1`.

Step 3: Now that we have the rank, we can easily filter the results to keep only the rows where `rn` is 1. We can do this by putting the previous query into a Common Table Expression (CTE), which is like a temporary named result, and then selecting from that CTE.

```SQL
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        salary,
        department_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM Salary
)
-- Select only the row with the highest salary for each employee (where rn = 1)
SELECT
    emp_id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    salary,
    department_id
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE rn = 1;
-- This gives us the highest salary record for each employee.
```

Explanation: We define a CTE named `RankedSalaries` containing the result from Step 2 (all original columns plus the `rn` column). Then, we select from this `RankedSalaries` CTE, adding a `WHERE rn = 1` clause. This filters out all rows except the one with the highest salary for each employee, because only that row was assigned a rank of 1 within its `emp_id` partition.

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the output to be ordered by `emp_id` in ascending order. We add an `ORDER BY` clause to the final `SELECT` statement.

```SQL
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        salary,
        department_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM Salary
)
SELECT
    emp_id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    salary,
    department_id
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY emp_id ASC;
-- This sorts the final results by emp_id from smallest to largest.
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY emp_id ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final result set by the `emp_id` column in ascending order (from smallest ID to largest).

This query now correctly identifies the current salary for each employee and formats the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        firstname,
        lastname,
        salary,
        department_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM Salary
)
SELECT
    emp_id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    salary,
    department_id
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY emp_id ASC;
```
