Table: `Users`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| account      | int     |
| name         | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
account is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the account number of each user in the bank.
There will be no two users having the same name in the table.
```

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| trans_id      | int     |
| account       | int     |
| amount        | int     |
| transacted_on | date    |
+---------------+---------+
trans_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains all changes made to all accounts.
amount is positive if the user received money and negative if they transferred money.
All accounts start with a balance of 0.
```

Write a solution to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than `10000`. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all transactions involving that account.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+------------+--------------+
| account    | name         |
+------------+--------------+
| 900001     | Alice        |
| 900002     | Bob          |
| 900003     | Charlie      |
+------------+--------------+
Transactions table:
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| trans_id   | account    | amount     | transacted_on |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 900001     | 7000       |  2020-08-01   |
| 2          | 900001     | 7000       |  2020-09-01   |
| 3          | 900001     | -3000      |  2020-09-02   |
| 4          | 900002     | 1000       |  2020-09-12   |
| 5          | 900003     | 6000       |  2020-08-07   |
| 6          | 900003     | 6000       |  2020-09-07   |
| 7          | 900003     | -4000      |  2020-09-11   |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+------------+
| name       | balance    |
+------------+------------+
| Alice      | 11000      |
+------------+------------+
Explanation:
Alice's balance is (7000 + 7000 - 3000) = 11000.
Bob's balance is 1000.
Charlie's balance is (6000 + 6000 - 4000) = 8000.
```

# Reporting Users with High Balances

To solve this problem, I need to calculate the current balance for each bank account by summing all transactions, then identify accounts with balances exceeding $10,000 along with their owners' names.

## Approach

1. **Calculate Balances**: Sum all transaction amounts grouped by account
2. **Join with Users**: Connect the balance information with user names
3. **Filter High Balances**: Only include accounts with balance > 10000
4. **Select Output Columns**: Return name and balance

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    u.name,
    SUM(t.amount) AS balance
FROM
    Users u
JOIN
    Transactions t ON u.account = t.account
GROUP BY
    u.account, u.name
HAVING
    SUM(t.amount) > 10000;
```

## Explanation

1. The JOIN connects each transaction to its account owner
2. GROUP BY combines all transactions for each account
3. SUM(t.amount) calculates the current balance
4. HAVING filters for balances over $10,000
5. In the example:
    - Alice's balance: 7000 + 7000 - 3000 = 11000 (included)
    - Bob's balance: 1000 (excluded)
    - Charlie's balance: 6000 + 6000 - 4000 = 8000 (excluded)

This solution efficiently calculates account balances and filters for high-value accounts while properly associating them with their owners.
