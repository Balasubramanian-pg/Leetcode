**Description**

Table: `emails`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| email_id    | int      |
| user_id     | int      |
| signup_date | datetime |
+-------------+----------+
(email_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the email ID, user ID, and signup date.
```

Table: `texts`

```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| text_id       | int      |
| email_id      | int      |
| signup_action | enum     |
| action_date   | datetime |
+---------------+----------+
(text_id, email_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
signup_action is an enum type of ('Verified', 'Not Verified').
Each row of this table contains the text ID, email ID, signup action, and action date.
```

Write a Solution to find the user IDs of those who **verified** their **sign-up** on the **second day**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

emails table:

```Plain
+----------+---------+---------------------+
| email_id | user_id | signup_date         |
+----------+---------+---------------------+
| 125      | 7771    | 2022-06-14 09:30:00|
| 433      | 1052    | 2022-07-09 08:15:00|
| 234      | 7005    | 2022-08-20 10:00:00|
+----------+---------+---------------------+
```

texts table:

```Plain
+---------+----------+--------------+---------------------+
| text_id | email_id | signup_action| action_date         |
+---------+----------+--------------+---------------------+
| 1       | 125      | Verified     | 2022-06-15 08:30:00|
| 2       | 433      | Not Verified | 2022-07-10 10:45:00|
| 4       | 234      | Verified     | 2022-08-21 09:30:00|
+---------+----------+--------------+---------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 7005    |
| 7771    |
+---------+
```

**Explanation:**

- User with user_id 7005 and email_id 234 signed up on 2022-08-20 10:00:00 and verified on second day of the signup.
- User with user_id 7771 and email_id 125 signed up on 2022-06-14 09:30:00 and verified on second day of the signup.

## Solutions

Let’s break down the solution step-by-step, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the `user_id` of users who verified their sign-up on the **second day** after their `signup_date`.

**Key Points:**

1. Join the `emails` and `texts` tables on `email_id`.
2. Calculate the difference between `action_date` and `signup_date`.
3. Filter rows where the difference is exactly **1 day**.
4. Ensure the `signup_action` is `'Verified'`.
5. Return the result ordered by `user_id`.

---

### **Step 2: Join the Tables**

First, join the `emails` and `texts` tables on `email_id` to link user sign-up data with verification actions.

```SQL
SELECT
    e.user_id,
    e.signup_date,
    t.action_date
FROM
    emails e
JOIN
    texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
```

**Explanation:**

- `**JOIN**`: Combines rows from both tables where `email_id` matches.
- `**SELECT**`: Retrieves `user_id`, `signup_date`, and `action_date` for analysis.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the Day Difference**

Next, calculate the difference between `action_date` and `signup_date` in days.

```SQL
SELECT
    e.user_id,
    DATEDIFF(t.action_date, e.signup_date) AS day_diff
FROM
    emails e
JOIN
    texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
```

**Explanation:**

- `**DATEDIFF(action_date, signup_date)**`: Returns the number of days between `action_date` and `signup_date`.

---

### **Step 4: Filter Verified Users on the Second Day**

Filter rows where:

1. `signup_action` is `'Verified'`.
2. The day difference is **1** (second day).

```SQL
SELECT
    e.user_id
FROM
    emails e
JOIN
    texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE
    t.signup_action = 'Verified'
    AND DATEDIFF(t.action_date, e.signup_date) = 1
```

**Explanation:**

- `**WHERE t.signup_action = 'Verified'**`: Ensures only verified users are considered.
- `**DATEDIFF(...) = 1**`: Filters for actions taken exactly 1 day after sign-up.

---

### **Step 5: Order the Result**

Finally, order the result by `user_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    e.user_id
FROM
    emails e
JOIN
    texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE
    t.signup_action = 'Verified'
    AND DATEDIFF(t.action_date, e.signup_date) = 1
ORDER BY
    e.user_id
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ORDER BY e.user_id**`: Sorts the result by `user_id` in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
SELECT
    e.user_id
FROM
    emails e
JOIN
    texts t ON e.email_id = t.email_id
WHERE
    t.signup_action = 'Verified'
    AND DATEDIFF(t.action_date, e.signup_date) = 1
ORDER BY
    e.user_id;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **Join**: Links `emails` and `texts` tables on `email_id`.
2. **Filter**: Keeps only verified users with a 1-day difference between sign-up and verification.
3. **Order**: Sorts the result by `user_id`.

This query returns the `user_id` of users who verified their sign-up on the second day, ordered by `user_id`.
