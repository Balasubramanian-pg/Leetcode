**Description**

Table: `NPV`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| year          | int     |
| npv           | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory and the corresponding net present value.
```

Table: `Queries`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| year          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
The table has information about the id and the year of each inventory query.
```

Write a solution to find the `npv` of each query of the `Queries` table.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
NPV table:
+------+--------+--------+
| id   | year   | npv    |
+------+--------+--------+
| 1    | 2018   | 100    |
| 7    | 2020   | 30     |
| 13   | 2019   | 40     |
| 1    | 2019   | 113    |
| 2    | 2008   | 121    |
| 3    | 2009   | 12     |
| 11   | 2020   | 99     |
| 7    | 2019   | 0      |
+------+--------+--------+
Queries table:
+------+--------+
| id   | year   |
+------+--------+
| 1    | 2019   |
| 2    | 2008   |
| 3    | 2009   |
| 7    | 2018   |
| 7    | 2019   |
| 7    | 2020   |
| 13   | 2019   |
+------+--------+
Output:
+------+--------+--------+
| id   | year   | npv    |
+------+--------+--------+
| 1    | 2019   | 113    |
| 2    | 2008   | 121    |
| 3    | 2009   | 12     |
| 7    | 2018   | 0      |
| 7    | 2019   | 0      |
| 7    | 2020   | 30     |
| 13   | 2019   | 40     |
+------+--------+--------+
Explanation:
The npv value of (7, 2018) is not present in the NPV table, we consider it 0.
The npv values of all other queries can be found in the NPV table.
```

I'll write a solution to find the NPV (net present value) for each query in the Queries table.

Let me analyze this problem:

1. We have two tables: NPV with columns (id, year, npv) and Queries with columns (id, year)
2. We need to find the NPV value for each id-year pair in the Queries table
3. If an id-year pair from Queries doesn't exist in NPV, we should return 0 as the NPV value

This is a classic LEFT JOIN scenario where we need to:

1. Take all records from Queries table
2. Join with the NPV table on both id and year
3. Return 0 for any missing NPV values

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    q.id,
    q.year,
    IFNULL(n.npv, 0) AS npv
FROM
    Queries q
LEFT JOIN
    NPV n ON q.id = n.id AND q.year = n.year
```

This query:

1. Selects all rows from the Queries table
2. Performs a LEFT JOIN with the NPV table matching on both id and year columns
3. Uses IFNULL (or COALESCE in some SQL variants) to return 0 when the NPV value is NULL
4. Returns the id, year, and calculated NPV value

The LEFT JOIN ensures that all rows from Queries are included in the result, even if there's no matching row in the NPV table. For those cases, the npv field will be NULL, which we convert to 0 using IFNULL().

Looking at the example data:

- The query (7, 2018) doesn't exist in the NPV table, so it gets npv = 0
- All other queries have matching entries in the NPV table, so they get their respective NPV values

The solution correctly handles all the test cases in the example.
