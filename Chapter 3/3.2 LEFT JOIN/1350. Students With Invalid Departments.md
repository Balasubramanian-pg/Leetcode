**Description**

Table: `Departments`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id of each department of a university.
```

Table: `Students`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| department_id | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the id of each student at a university and the id of the department he/she studies at.
```

Find the id and the name of all students who are enrolled in departments that no longer exist.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Departments table:
+------+--------------------------+
| id   | name                     |
+------+--------------------------+
| 1    | Electrical Engineering   |
| 7    | Computer Engineering     |
| 13   | Bussiness Administration |
+------+--------------------------+
Students table:
+------+----------+---------------+
| id   | name     | department_id |
+------+----------+---------------+
| 23   | Alice    | 1             |
| 1    | Bob      | 7             |
| 5    | Jennifer | 13            |
| 2    | John     | 14            |
| 4    | Jasmine  | 77            |
| 3    | Steve    | 74            |
| 6    | Luis     | 1             |
| 8    | Jonathan | 7             |
| 7    | Daiana   | 33            |
| 11   | Madelynn | 1             |
+------+----------+---------------+
Output:
+------+----------+
| id   | name     |
+------+----------+
| 2    | John     |
| 7    | Daiana   |
| 4    | Jasmine  |
| 3    | Steve    |
+------+----------+
Explanation:
John, Daiana, Steve, and Jasmine are enrolled in departments 14, 33, 74, and 77 respectively. department 14, 33, 74, and 77 do not exist in the Departments table.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Subquery**

We can directly use a subquery to find all students who are not in the `Departments` table.

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT id, name
FROM Students
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Departments);
```

**Solution 2: Left Join**

We can also use a left join to join the `Students` table with the `Departments` table on the condition of `Students.department_id = Departments.id`, and then filter out the students whose `Departments.id` is `NULL`.

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM
    Students AS s
    LEFT JOIN Departments AS d ON s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NULL;
```

I'll analyze both solutions for finding students enrolled in non-existent departments.

## Problem Summary

We need to identify students who are enrolled in departments that don't exist in the Departments table.

## Solution 1: Using NOT IN with Subquery

```SQL
SELECT id, name
FROM Students
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM Departments);
```

### How it works:

1. The subquery `(SELECT id FROM Departments)` retrieves all valid department IDs
2. The main query selects students whose `department_id` is NOT IN that list of valid departments
3. This effectively finds all students associated with non-existent departments

### Analysis:

- **Pros**: Simple, intuitive approach that directly expresses the problem statement
- **Considerations**:
    - Performance may degrade with very large tables as the subquery executes for each row
    - Important note: This approach can be problematic if any `department_id` in Students is NULL, as NULL NOT IN (...) evaluates to NULL (not TRUE), potentially missing records

## Solution 2: Using LEFT JOIN with NULL Check

```SQL
SELECT s.id, s.name
FROM
    Students AS s
    LEFT JOIN Departments AS d ON s.department_id = d.id
WHERE d.id IS NULL;
```

### How it works:

1. The LEFT JOIN keeps all records from Students and matches records from Departments
2. When a student's department_id doesn't match any id in Departments, the Departments columns will be NULL
3. The WHERE clause filters for only these unmatched records (where d.id IS NULL)

### Analysis:

- **Pros**:
    - Properly handles NULL values in department_id
    - Often more efficient for larger datasets
    - Avoids potential issues with the NOT IN approach
- **Considerations**:
    - Slightly more complex syntax
    - JOIN operations can be resource-intensive on very large tables, but modern SQL optimizers handle this well

## Example Walkthrough

Using the example data, let's trace through Solution 2:

After the LEFT JOIN, records for students with department_id 14, 33, 74, and 77 would have NULL values for all Departments columns because these IDs don't exist in the Departments table:

```Plain
Students with non-existent departments:
+------+----------+---------------+------+------+
| id   | name     | department_id | d.id | d.name     |
+------+----------+---------------+------+------+
| 2    | John     | 14            | NULL | NULL |
| 4    | Jasmine  | 77            | NULL | NULL |
| 3    | Steve    | 74            | NULL | NULL |
| 7    | Daiana   | 33            | NULL | NULL |
+------+----------+---------------+------+------+
```

The WHERE d.id IS NULL filter would then select only these rows, giving us the required output.

## Recommendation

Both solutions are valid, but Solution 2 (LEFT JOIN) is generally preferred in professional environments because:

1. It handles NULL values correctly
2. It often has better performance characteristics
3. It follows the SQL standard practice for finding "orphaned" records
4. It's more versatile if the query needs to be expanded later

Solution 1 is more concise but requires caution regarding NULL handling. If you know your data has no NULL values for department_id, it can be a perfectly valid choice.
