**Description**

Table: `TVProgram`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| program_date  | date    |
| content_id    | int     |
| channel       | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(program_date, content_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information of the programs on the TV.
content_id is the id of the program in some channel on the TV.
```

Table: `Content`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| content_id       | varchar |
| title            | varchar |
| Kids_content     | enum    |
| content_type     | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
content_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Kids_content is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where:
'Y' means is content for kids otherwise 'N' is not content for kids.
content_type is the category of the content as movies, series, etc.
```

Write a solution to report the distinct titles of the kid-friendly movies streamed in **June 2020**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
TVProgram table:
+--------------------+--------------+-------------+
| program_date       | content_id   | channel     |
+--------------------+--------------+-------------+
| 2020-06-10 08:00   | 1            | LC-Channel  |
| 2020-05-11 12:00   | 2            | LC-Channel  |
| 2020-05-12 12:00   | 3            | LC-Channel  |
| 2020-05-13 14:00   | 4            | Disney Ch   |
| 2020-06-18 14:00   | 4            | Disney Ch   |
| 2020-07-15 16:00   | 5            | Disney Ch   |
+--------------------+--------------+-------------+
Content table:
+------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
| content_id | title          | Kids_content  | content_type  |
+------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1          | Leetcode Movie | N             | Movies        |
| 2          | Alg. for Kids  | Y             | Series        |
| 3          | Database Sols  | N             | Series        |
| 4          | Aladdin        | Y             | Movies        |
| 5          | Cinderella     | Y             | Movies        |
+------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+
Output:
+--------------+
| title        |
+--------------+
| Aladdin      |
+--------------+
Explanation:
"Leetcode Movie" is not a content for kids.
"Alg. for Kids" is not a movie.
"Database Sols" is not a movie
"Alladin" is a movie, content for kids and was streamed in June 2020.
"Cinderella" was not streamed in June 2020.
```

I'll write a solution to find the distinct titles of kid-friendly movies streamed in June 2020.

For this problem, we need to:

1. Join the TVProgram and Content tables
2. Filter for programs in June 2020
3. Filter for kid-friendly content (Kids_content = 'Y')
4. Filter for movies (content_type = 'Movies')
5. Select distinct titles

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c.title
FROM TVProgram t
JOIN Content c ON t.content_id = c.content_id
WHERE
    t.program_date BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30'
    AND c.Kids_content = 'Y'
    AND c.content_type = 'Movies';
```

This solution:

1. Joins the TVProgram and Content tables using content_id
2. Uses the BETWEEN operator to filter for dates in June 2020
3. Filters for kid-friendly content (Kids_content = 'Y')
4. Filters for movies (content_type = 'Movies')
5. Uses DISTINCT to avoid duplicate titles in case a movie was streamed multiple times

Alternative approach using date functions:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c.title
FROM TVProgram t
JOIN Content c ON t.content_id = c.content_id
WHERE
    YEAR(t.program_date) = 2020
    AND MONTH(t.program_date) = 6
    AND c.Kids_content = 'Y'
    AND c.content_type = 'Movies';
```

Looking at the example data, "Aladdin" is the only movie that is kid-friendly (Kids_content = 'Y') and was streamed in June 2020, which matches the expected output.
