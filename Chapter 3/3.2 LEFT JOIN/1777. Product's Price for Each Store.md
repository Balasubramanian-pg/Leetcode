**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store       | enum    |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, (product_id, store) is the primary key for this table.
store is a category of type ('store1', 'store2', 'store3') where each represents the store this product is available at.
price is the price of the product at this store.
```

Find the price of each product in each store.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+-------------+--------+-------+
| product_id  | store  | price |
+-------------+--------+-------+
| 0           | store1 | 95    |
| 0           | store3 | 105   |
| 0           | store2 | 100   |
| 1           | store1 | 70    |
| 1           | store3 | 80    |
+-------------+--------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| product_id  | store1 | store2 | store3 |
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
| 0           | 95     | 100    | 105    |
| 1           | 70     | null   | 80     |
+-------------+--------+--------+--------+
Explanation:
Product 0 price's are 95 for store1, 100 for store2 and, 105 for store3.
Product 1 price's are 70 for store1, 80 for store3 and, it's not sold in store2.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to transform the data from a row-based format (where each row has a product_id, store, and price) to a column-based format (where each row has a product_id and columns for each store's price).

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Understand the PIVOT operation

This problem requires a pivot operation, where we transform rows into columns. In SQL, we can achieve this using conditional aggregation or the PIVOT function (in databases that support it).

### Step 2: Using conditional aggregation (works in most databases)

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store1' THEN price END) AS store1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store2' THEN price END) AS store2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store3' THEN price END) AS store3
FROM
    Products
GROUP BY
    product_id;
```

Explanation: For each product_id, we use CASE statements to conditionally place the price in the appropriate column based on the store value. The MAX function is used to aggregate the values (since there's only one price per product per store, MAX just selects that value). We then group by product_id to get one row per product.

### Step 3: Alternative approach using PIVOT (for SQL Server)

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    store1,
    store2,
    store3
FROM
    Products
PIVOT (
    MAX(price) FOR store IN (store1, store2, store3)
) AS pvt;
```

Explanation: If your database supports the PIVOT function (like SQL Server), you can use this more concise syntax. The PIVOT function rotates rows into columns, specifying store as the pivoting column and MAX(price) as the aggregation function.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store1' THEN price END) AS store1,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store2' THEN price END) AS store2,
    MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'store3' THEN price END) AS store3
FROM
    Products
GROUP BY
    product_id;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution using conditional aggregation, which works across most database systems. For each product_id, it creates columns for store1, store2, and store3, filling in the price values where they exist and NULL where they don't. The result is exactly what the problem asks for - a pivot table showing the price of each product in each store.
