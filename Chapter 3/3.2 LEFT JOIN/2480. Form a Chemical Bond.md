**Description**

Table: `Elements`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| symbol      | varchar |
| type        | enum    |
| electrons   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
symbol is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information of one element.
type is an ENUM (category) of type ('Metal', 'Nonmetal', 'Noble')
 - If type is Noble, electrons is 0.
 - If type is Metal, electrons is the number of electrons that one atom of this element can give.
 - If type is Nonmetal, electrons is the number of electrons that one atom of this element needs.
```

Two elements can form a bond if one of them is `'Metal'` and the other is `'Nonmetal'`.

Write a solution to find all the pairs of elements that can form a bond.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Elements table:
+--------+----------+-----------+
| symbol | type     | electrons |
+--------+----------+-----------+
| He     | Noble    | 0         |
| Na     | Metal    | 1         |
| Ca     | Metal    | 2         |
| La     | Metal    | 3         |
| Cl     | Nonmetal | 1         |
| O      | Nonmetal | 2         |
| N      | Nonmetal | 3         |
+--------+----------+-----------+
Output:
+-------+----------+
| metal | nonmetal |
+-------+----------+
| La    | Cl       |
| Ca    | Cl       |
| Na    | Cl       |
| La    | O        |
| Ca    | O        |
| Na    | O        |
| La    | N        |
| Ca    | N        |
| Na    | N        |

Explanation:
Metal elements are La, Ca, and Na.
Nonmeal elements are Cl, O, and N.
Each Metal element pairs with a Nonmetal element in the output table.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's break down this problem.

The goal is to find all possible pairs of elements where one element is a 'Metal' and the other is a 'Nonmetal'. We need to list the symbol of the metal element and the symbol of the nonmetal element for each pair.

We'll start by looking at the `Elements` table and then see how we can combine information from it to find these pairs.

Step 1: We need to work with the `Elements` table. Since we are pairing elements from the _same_ table, we'll need to use the table more than once in our query. We can do this by giving the table different temporary names, or 'aliases', when we use it. Let's call one instance `e1`.

```SQL
FROM Elements e1
```

Explanation: This line says we are starting our query by looking at the `Elements` table. We are giving it a temporary name `e1` so we can refer to it more easily.

Step 2: We need to find pairs, which means we need to combine rows from the `Elements` table with other rows from the _same_ `Elements` table. We do this using a `JOIN`. We'll join `Elements` (`e1`) with another instance of the `Elements` table, which we'll call `e2`.

```SQL
FROM Elements e1
INNER JOIN Elements e2
```

Explanation: We are combining the `Elements` table (aliased as `e1`) with itself (aliased as `e2`). An `INNER JOIN` means we will only keep rows where there is a match based on a condition we will specify next.

Step 3: The problem states that a bond can form if one element is a 'Metal' and the other is a 'Nonmetal'. This is the condition for our join. We want to pair a row from `e1` where the type is 'Metal' with a row from `e2` where the type is 'Nonmetal'.

```SQL
FROM Elements e1
INNER JOIN Elements e2 ON e1.type = 'Metal' AND e2.type = 'Nonmetal'
```

Explanation: This is the crucial part of the join. We are joining `e1` and `e2` only when the `type` column in `e1` is 'Metal' AND the `type` column in `e2` is 'Nonmetal'. This creates rows containing combinations of a metal element (from `e1`) and a nonmetal element (from `e2`).

Step 4: Now that we have the correct combinations (metal from `e1`, nonmetal from `e2`), we need to select the information we want for the final output. The desired output columns are `metal` and `nonmetal`. These should be the `symbol` from our 'metal' instance (`e1`) and the `symbol` from our 'nonmetal' instance (`e2`). We'll use `AS` to give these selected columns the correct names.

```SQL
SELECT
    e1.symbol AS metal,
    e2.symbol AS nonmetal
FROM Elements e1
INNER JOIN Elements e2 ON e1.type = 'Metal' AND e2.type = 'Nonmetal'
```

Explanation: We are selecting the `symbol` column from the `e1` instance of the table (which represents the metal element) and naming it `metal`. We are also selecting the `symbol` column from the `e2` instance (representing the nonmetal element) and naming it `nonmetal`.

This query now selects the symbol of every metal element paired with the symbol of every nonmetal element, which is exactly what the problem asks for.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    e1.symbol AS metal,
    e2.symbol AS nonmetal
FROM Elements e1
INNER JOIN Elements e2 ON e1.type = 'Metal' AND e2.type = 'Nonmetal';
```
