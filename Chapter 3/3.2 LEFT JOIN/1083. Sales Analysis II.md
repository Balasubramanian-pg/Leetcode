**Description**

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
```

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| buyer_id    | int     |
| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table might have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
buyer_id is never NULL.
sale_date is never NULL.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
```

Write a solution to report the **buyers** who have bought _S8_ but not _iPhone_. Note that _S8_ and _iPhone_ are products presented in the `Product` table.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+

| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

# SQL Problem: Buyers Who Purchased S8 but Not iPhone

Let me solve this problem step by step while explaining my thought process.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Analyze what we're being asked to find.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to find buyers who purchased an S8 product but did not purchase an iPhone. We need to:  

1. Identify buyers who bought S8 (product_id = 1)
2. Filter out those who also bought iPhone (product_id = 3)
3. Return only the buyer_id column

This is a classic "set difference" problem where we need to find elements in one set but not in another.

### 2. Identifying the Data We Need

**Procedural step:** Determine which tables and columns we need to use.

**My thought process:**  
We'll need both tables in this problem:  

- Product: To identify which product_id corresponds to S8 and iPhone
- Sales: To determine who bought which products

From the Product table, we can see that:

- product_id = 1 corresponds to S8
- product_id = 3 corresponds to iPhone

So now we need to find buyer_ids in the Sales table who have a record with product_id = 1 but don't have any records with product_id = 3.

### 3. Planning the Solution Approach

**Procedural step:** Choose a method to solve this "set difference" problem.

**My thought process:**  
There are several ways to approach this:  

1. **Using NOT EXISTS**: Find buyers who bought S8 and for whom there doesn't exist a record of buying iPhone
2. **Using NOT IN**: Find buyers who bought S8 and whose IDs are not in the list of buyers who bought iPhone
3. **Using LEFT JOIN / IS NULL**: Find buyers who bought S8 left joined with buyers who bought iPhone, where the right side is NULL
4. **Using EXCEPT/MINUS**: Find the set difference between buyers who bought S8 and buyers who bought iPhone (syntax varies by database)

Let me implement these approaches.

### 4. Approach 1: Using NOT EXISTS

**Procedural step:** Implement the solution using a NOT EXISTS subquery.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT s1.buyer_id
FROM Sales s1
JOIN Product p1 ON s1.product_id = p1.product_id
WHERE p1.product_name = 'S8'
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Sales s2
    JOIN Product p2 ON s2.product_id = p2.product_id
    WHERE p2.product_name = 'iPhone'
    AND s2.buyer_id = s1.buyer_id
);
```

**My thought process:**  
This query:  

1. Selects buyers from the Sales table who bought a product
2. Joins with the Product table to filter only those who bought S8
3. Uses NOT EXISTS to exclude buyers who also have a record of buying iPhone
4. Uses DISTINCT to ensure each buyer is only returned once (in case they bought S8 multiple times)

The subquery checks if there exists any record where the same buyer bought an iPhone. If there's no such record, the buyer is included in our results.

### 5. Approach 2: Using NOT IN

**Procedural step:** Implement the solution using NOT IN.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT s.buyer_id
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.product_name = 'S8'
AND s.buyer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT s2.buyer_id
    FROM Sales s2
    JOIN Product p2 ON s2.product_id = p2.product_id
    WHERE p2.product_name = 'iPhone'
);
```

**My thought process:**  
This approach:  

1. Selects buyers who bought S8
2. Excludes those whose buyer_id appears in the list of buyers who bought iPhone

The logic is similar to the NOT EXISTS approach, but the implementation is slightly different. NOT IN compares against a list of values, while NOT EXISTS checks for the existence of matching rows.

### 6. Approach 3: Using LEFT JOIN and IS NULL

**Procedural step:** Implement the solution using LEFT JOIN with IS NULL.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT s1.buyer_id
FROM Sales s1
JOIN Product p1 ON s1.product_id = p1.product_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT s2.buyer_id
    FROM Sales s2
    JOIN Product p2 ON s2.product_id = p2.product_id
    WHERE p2.product_name = 'iPhone'
) iPhone_buyers ON s1.buyer_id = iPhone_buyers.buyer_id
WHERE p1.product_name = 'S8'
AND iPhone_buyers.buyer_id IS NULL;
```

**My thought process:**  
This approach:  

1. Gets all buyers who bought S8
2. Left joins with a subquery that gets all buyers who bought iPhone
3. Filters for cases where there's no match on the right side (indicates the buyer didn't buy iPhone)

LEFT JOIN keeps all records from the left table and matches them with records from the right table where possible. When there's no match, the columns from the right table are NULL. By filtering for IS NULL, we find buyers who bought S8 but have no corresponding record for iPhone.

### 7. Simplifying the Solution

**Procedural step:** Consider ways to make the solution more efficient.

**My thought process:**  
I notice that in the example data, we're given the product_id values directly. Instead of joining with the Product table to get the product names, we could use these IDs directly, which would be more efficient:  

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
FROM Sales
WHERE product_id = 1  -- S8
AND buyer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT buyer_id
    FROM Sales
    WHERE product_id = 3  -- iPhone
);
```

However, this assumes the product_id mappings are static. For a more robust solution that adapts to any product_id mappings, I should stick with the joins to the Product table.

### 8. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Verify the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution using the NOT EXISTS approach:  

Buyers who bought S8 (product_id = 1):

- buyer_id 1
- buyer_id 3

Buyers who bought iPhone (product_id = 3):

- buyer_id 3

After applying NOT EXISTS filter:

- buyer_id 1 (bought S8 but not iPhone)

This matches the expected output.

### 9. Considering Edge Cases

**Procedural step:** Think about potential edge cases.

**My thought process:**  
Some edge cases to consider:  

1. **No buyers bought S8**: The query would return an empty result, which is correct.
2. **All buyers who bought S8 also bought iPhone**: The query would return an empty result, which is correct.
3. **NULL values in buyer_id**: The problem states buyer_id is never NULL, so we don't need to handle this.

Our solution handles these cases correctly.

## Final Solution

After considering all approaches, I recommend the NOT EXISTS solution for its clarity and performance characteristics:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT buyer_id
FROM Sales
WHERE product_id = (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM Product
    WHERE product_name = 'S8'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Sales s2
    WHERE s2.buyer_id = Sales.buyer_id
    AND s2.product_id = (
        SELECT product_id
        FROM Product
        WHERE product_name = 'iPhone'
    )
);
```

This solution:

1. Uses subqueries to find the product_ids for S8 and iPhone, making the solution adaptable to any product_id mappings
2. Uses NOT EXISTS for efficient filtering, avoiding potential issues with NULL values that could occur with NOT IN
3. Uses DISTINCT to ensure each buyer is only returned once
4. Returns only the buyer_id column as required
5. Correctly implements the logic to find buyers who bought S8 but not iPhone

The NOT EXISTS approach is generally more efficient than LEFT JOIN for this type of query, especially for larger datasets, as it can stop checking as soon as it finds a single matching record.
