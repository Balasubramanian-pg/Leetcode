Table: `Product`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
```

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| buyer_id    | int     |
| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table can have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
```

Write a solution to report the **products** that were **only** sold in the first quarter of `2019`. That is, between `2019-01-01` and `2019-03-31` inclusive.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 4        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | product_name |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | S8           |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.
```

# Finding Products Sold Only in Q1 2019

To solve this problem, I need to identify products that were sold exclusively during the first quarter of 2019 (January 1 to March 31). This requires checking two conditions for each product:

1. It was sold during Q1 2019
2. It was not sold outside of Q1 2019

## Approach

1. **Find Products Sold in Q1 2019**: Identify all products with sales between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31
2. **Exclude Products Sold Outside Q1 2019**: From the Q1 products, remove any that also have sales outside this period
3. **Join with Product Table**: Get the product names for the remaining products

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM Product p
WHERE p.product_id IN (
    -- Products sold in Q1 2019
    SELECT s.product_id
    FROM Sales s
    WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'
)
AND p.product_id NOT IN (
    -- Products sold outside Q1 2019
    SELECT s.product_id
    FROM Sales s
    WHERE s.sale_date < '2019-01-01' OR s.sale_date > '2019-03-31'
);
```

## Explanation

- The first subquery identifies all products sold during Q1 2019 (Jan 1 - Mar 31)
- The second subquery identifies products sold outside this period
- The main query selects products that are in the first group but not in the second group
- Finally, it joins with the Product table to get the product names
- In the example:
    - Product 1 (S8) was only sold on 2019-01-21 (within Q1)
    - Product 2 (G4) was sold in both Q1 and Q2
    - Product 3 (iPhone) was only sold in Q2
- Therefore, only Product 1 meets both criteria and is included in the result

This approach efficiently filters products by checking both inclusion and exclusion conditions using subqueries.
