**Description**

Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| customer_id  | int  |
| year         | int  |
| revenue      | int  |
+--------------+------+
(customer_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the customer ID and the revenue of customers in different years.
Note that this revenue can be negative.
```

Write a solution to report the customers with **postive revenue** in the year 2021.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+-------------+------+---------+
| customer_id | year | revenue |
+-------------+------+---------+
| 1           | 2018 | 50      |
| 1           | 2021 | 30      |
| 1           | 2020 | 70      |
| 2           | 2021 | -50     |
| 3           | 2018 | 10      |
| 3           | 2016 | 50      |
| 4           | 2021 | 20      |
+-------------+------+---------+
Output:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 4           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
Customer 1 has revenue equal to 30 in the year 2021.
Customer 2 has revenue equal to -50 in the year 2021.
Customer 3 has no revenue in the year 2021.
Customer 4 has revenue equal to 20 in the year 2021.
Thus only customers 1 and 4 have positive revenue in the year 2021.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find customer_ids who had positive revenue specifically in the year 2021. We need to:

1. Filter the data to only include records from 2021
2. Further filter to include only customers with positive revenue
3. Return just the customer_id column

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Select from the Customers table

```SQL
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customers
```

Explanation: We start with the basic structure of selecting the customer_id column from the Customers table.

## Step 2: Filter for records from the year 2021

```SQL
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customers
WHERE year = 2021
```

Explanation: We add a WHERE clause to filter only the records from the year 2021. This narrows down our dataset to just entries from that specific year.

## Step 3: Filter for positive revenue

```SQL
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customers
WHERE year = 2021 AND revenue > 0
```

Explanation: We add another condition to our WHERE clause using AND. This ensures we only get customers who had positive revenue (greater than 0) in 2021.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customers
WHERE year = 2021 AND revenue > 0
```

This query does exactly what the problem asks:

- It selects only the customer_id column
- It filters for records from the year 2021
- It ensures only customers with positive revenue are included
- Looking at the example data, this would return customer_ids 1 and 4, matching the expected output

The solution is straightforward because the problem requirements map directly to SQL filtering capabilities.
