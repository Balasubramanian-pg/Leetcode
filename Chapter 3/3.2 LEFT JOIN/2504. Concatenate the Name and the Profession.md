**Description**

Table: `Person`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| person_id   | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| profession  | ENUM    |
+-------------+---------+
person_id is the primary key (column with a unique value) for this table.
Each row in this table contains a person's ID, name, and profession.
The profession column in an enum of the type ('Doctor', 'Singer', 'Actor', 'Player', 'Engineer', or 'Lawyer')
```

Write a solution to report each person's name followed by the first letter of their profession enclosed in parentheses.

Return the result table **ordered** by `person_id` in **descending order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Person table:
+-----------+-------+------------+
| person_id | name  | profession |
+-----------+-------+------------+
| 1         | Alex  | Singer     |
| 3         | Alice | Actor      |
| 2         | Bob   | Player     |
| 4         | Messi | Doctor     |
| 6         | Tyson | Engineer   |
| 5         | Meir  | Lawyer     |
+-----------+-------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+----------+
| person_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| 6         | Tyson(E) |
| 5         | Meir(L)  |
| 4         | Messi(D) |
| 3         | Alice(A) |
| 2         | Bob(P)   |
| 1         | Alex(S)  |
+-----------+----------+
Explanation: Note that there should not be any white space between the name and the first letter of the profession.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to display the `person_id` and a combined string for each person, where the string is their name followed by the first letter of their profession in parentheses. The results need to be sorted by `person_id` from largest to smallest.

We will work with the `Person` table.

Step 1: We need to select the `person_id` column for the output.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id
FROM Person;
```

Explanation: This simply selects the `person_id` from the `Person` table. This is the first column required in the output.

Step 2: We also need the person's `name` and their `profession` to build the required output string. Let's include them for now, although the final output column will be a combination.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    name,
    profession
FROM Person;
```

Explanation: We now select the `person_id`, `name`, and `profession` columns from the `Person` table.

Step 3: The problem asks for the _first letter_ of the `profession`. We can get the first character of a string using a function like `LEFT()` or `SUBSTRING()`. `LEFT(column_name, number_of_characters)` is straightforward.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    name,
    profession,
    LEFT(profession, 1) AS profession_initial
FROM Person;
```

Explanation: We added `LEFT(profession, 1)`. This function takes the `profession` string and returns the first 1 character. We give it a temporary name `profession_initial` just to see what it produces at this stage.

Step 4: Now we need to combine the `name`, an opening parenthesis `(`, the `profession_initial`, and a closing parenthesis `)`. We can use a string concatenation function like `CONCAT()` for this.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    -- Combine name, '(', the initial, and ')'
    CONCAT(name, '(', LEFT(profession, 1), ')') AS combined_name
FROM Person;
```

Explanation: We replace the individual `name`, `profession`, and `profession_initial` selections with a single `CONCAT()` function. `CONCAT()` joins all the strings provided as arguments together. We join the `name` column, the literal string '(', the first letter of `profession` (using `LEFT(profession, 1)`), and the literal string ')'. We name this new combined column `combined_name`.

Step 5: The required output column for the combined string is named `name`, not `combined_name`. We need to change the alias.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    -- Combine the parts and name the resulting column 'name'
    CONCAT(name, '(', LEFT(profession, 1), ')') AS name
FROM Person;
```

Explanation: We simply changed the alias of the `CONCAT` result from `combined_name` to `name` to match the desired output column name.

Step 6: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `person_id` in descending order. We use the `ORDER BY` clause for this. `DESC` indicates descending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    CONCAT(name, '(', LEFT(profession, 1), ')') AS name
FROM Person
ORDER BY person_id DESC;
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY person_id DESC` at the end of the query. This sorts the entire result set based on the `person_id` column, arranging the rows from the highest `person_id` to the lowest.

This completes all the requirements of the problem.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    person_id,
    CONCAT(name, '(', LEFT(profession, 1), ')') AS name
FROM Person
ORDER BY person_id DESC;
```
