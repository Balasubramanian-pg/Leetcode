**Description**

Table: `Ads`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ad_id         | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| action        | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of an Ad, the ID of a user, and the action taken by this user regarding this Ad.
The action column is an ENUM (category) type of ('Clicked', 'Viewed', 'Ignored').
```

A company is running Ads and wants to calculate the performance of each Ad.

Performance of the Ad is measured using Click-Through Rate (CTR) where:

Write a solutionÂ to find the `ctr` of each Ad. **Round** `ctr` to **two decimal points**.

Return the result table ordered by `ctr` in **descending order** and by `ad_id` in **ascending order** in case of a tie.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Ads table:
+-------+---------+---------+
| ad_id | user_id | action  |
+-------+---------+---------+
| 1     | 1       | Clicked |
| 2     | 2       | Clicked |
| 3     | 3       | Viewed  |
| 5     | 5       | Ignored |
| 1     | 7       | Ignored |
| 2     | 7       | Viewed  |
| 3     | 5       | Clicked |
| 1     | 4       | Viewed  |
| 2     | 11      | Viewed  |
| 1     | 2       | Clicked |
+-------+---------+---------+
Output:
+-------+-------+
| ad_id | ctr   |
+-------+-------+
| 1     | 66.67 |
| 3     | 50.00 |
| 2     | 33.33 |
| 5     | 0.00  |
+-------+-------+
Explanation:
for ad_id = 1, ctr = (2/(2+1)) * 100 = 66.67
for ad_id = 2, ctr = (1/(1+2)) * 100 = 33.33
for ad_id = 3, ctr = (1/(1+1)) * 100 = 50.00
for ad_id = 5, ctr = 0.00, Note that ad_id = 5 has no clicks or views.
Note that we do not care about Ignored Ads.
```

**Solutions**

I'll analyze this SQL solution for calculating Click-Through Rate (CTR) per advertisement.

## Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to:

1. Calculate CTR for each ad
2. CTR = (number of clicks / (number of clicks + number of views)) * 100
3. Round CTR to 2 decimal places
4. Sort by CTR (descending) then ad_id (ascending)
5. Ignore any actions with 'Ignored' status

## Solution Analysis

```SQL
SELECT
    ad_id,
    ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(action = 'Clicked') / SUM(action IN('Clicked', 'Viewed')) * 100, 0), 2) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1;
```

Breaking down this solution:

### 1. GROUP BY and Aggregation

- `GROUP BY 1` groups results by the first column in the SELECT list (ad_id)
- This creates one row per unique ad_id for our result

### 2. CTR Calculation Logic

The core of the solution uses several SQL techniques:

- `action = 'Clicked'` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 (true) or 0 (false)
- `SUM(action = 'Clicked')` counts how many rows have 'Clicked' action for each ad_id
- `action IN('Clicked', 'Viewed')` counts rows that are either 'Clicked' or 'Viewed'
- `SUM(action IN('Clicked', 'Viewed'))` gives the denominator (clicks + views)
- The division and multiplication by 100 calculates the percentage

### 3. Handling Edge Cases

- `IFNULL(..., 0)` handles cases where there are no clicks or views, setting CTR to 0
- This is important for ads like ad_id = 5 in the example, which only has 'Ignored' actions

### 4. Formatting and Sorting

- `ROUND(..., 2)` formats the result to 2 decimal places as required
- `ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1` sorts by CTR (descending) and then by ad_id (ascending) for ties

## Step-by-Step Execution

Let's trace through the example data:

For ad_id = 1:

- 'Clicked' actions: 2 (user_id 1 and 2)
- 'Viewed' actions: 1 (user_id 4)
- 'Ignored' actions: 1 (user_id 7) - not counted
- CTR = (2 / (2 + 1)) * 100 = 66.67%

For ad_id = 2:

- 'Clicked' actions: 1 (user_id 2)
- 'Viewed' actions: 2 (user_id 7 and 11)
- CTR = (1 / (1 + 2)) * 100 = 33.33%

For ad_id = 3:

- 'Clicked' actions: 1 (user_id 5)
- 'Viewed' actions: 1 (user_id 3)
- CTR = (1 / (1 + 1)) * 100 = 50.00%

For ad_id = 5:

- No 'Clicked' or 'Viewed' actions
- CTR = 0.00%

## Alternative Approaches

Another way to write this query would be using explicit CASE expressions and COUNT:

```SQL
SELECT
    ad_id,
    ROUND(
      IFNULL(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'Clicked' THEN 1 END) /
        COUNT(CASE WHEN action IN ('Clicked', 'Viewed') THEN 1 END) * 100,
        0
      ),
      2
    ) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id;
```

This approach is more verbose but might be more readable for those unfamiliar with the boolean expression aggregation technique.

The given solution is elegant and efficient, directly computing the CTR with minimal code while handling all edge cases properly.
