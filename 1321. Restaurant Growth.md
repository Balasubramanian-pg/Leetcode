Table: `Customer`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
```

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). `average_amount` should be **rounded to two decimal places**.

Return the result table ordered by `visited_on` **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customer table:
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+
| customer_id | name         | visited_on   | amount      |
+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------------+

| 3           | Jade         | 2019-01-03   | 120         |
| 4           | Khaled       | 2019-01-04   | 130         |

Output:
+--------------+--------------+----------------+

| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
Explanation:
1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86

# Solution for Restaurant Revenue Moving Average

To solve this problem, I need to calculate a 7-day moving average of customer payments, including the current day and the previous 6 days. The solution involves aggregating daily totals and then computing the windowed averages.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
WITH DailyTotals AS (
    SELECT
        visited_on,
        SUM(amount) AS daily_amount
    FROM
        Customer
    GROUP BY
        visited_on
),
MovingAverages AS (
    SELECT
        a.visited_on,
        SUM(b.daily_amount) AS amount,
        ROUND(SUM(b.daily_amount) / 7, 2) AS average_amount
    FROM
        DailyTotals a
    JOIN
        DailyTotals b ON DATEDIFF(a.visited_on, b.visited_on) BETWEEN 0 AND 6
    GROUP BY
        a.visited_on
    HAVING
        COUNT(b.visited_on) = 7
)
SELECT
    visited_on,
    amount,
    average_amount
FROM
    MovingAverages
ORDER BY
    visited_on;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Calculate Daily Totals**:
    - First, create a CTE (`DailyTotals`) that sums all amounts for each day
    - This gives us the total revenue per day
2. **Compute 7-Day Moving Averages**:
    - For each day in the DailyTotals (a), join with all days (b) that are within 6 days before it
    - Sum the amounts for each 7-day window
    - Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 7 and rounding to 2 decimal places
    - The `HAVING COUNT(b.visited_on) = 7` ensures we only include complete 7-day windows
3. **Filter and Order Results**:
    - Select only the complete 7-day windows
    - Order by visited_on to get chronological results

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data, the calculation works as follows:

- **2019-01-07** (first complete window):
    - Sum: 100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 = 860
    - Average: 860/7 = 122.857... → 122.86
- **2019-01-08**:
    - Sum: 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 = 840
    - Average: 840/7 = 120.00
- **2019-01-09**:
    - Sum: 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 = 840
    - Average: 840/7 = 120.00
- **2019-01-10**:
    - Includes two transactions on 2019-01-10 (130 + 150)
    - Sum: 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150 = 1000
    - Average: 1000/7 = 142.857... → 142.86

The solution correctly handles:

- Daily aggregation of multiple customer payments
- 7-day sliding window calculation
- Proper rounding of averages
- Only showing complete 7-day windows
