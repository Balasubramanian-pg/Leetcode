Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| emp_id      | int  |
| event_day   | date |
| in_time     | int  |
| out_time    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.
```

Write a solution to calculate the total time **in minutes**  
spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one  
day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in  
the office for a single entry is  
`out_time - in_time`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| emp_id | event_day  | in_time | out_time |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 4       | 32       |
| 1      | 2020-11-28 | 55      | 200      |
| 1      | 2020-12-03 | 1       | 42       |
| 2      | 2020-11-28 | 3       | 33       |
| 2      | 2020-12-09 | 47      | 74       |
+--------+------------+---------+----------+
Output:
+------------+--------+------------+
| day        | emp_id | total_time |
+------------+--------+------------+
| 2020-11-28 | 1      | 173        |
| 2020-11-28 | 2      | 30         |
| 2020-12-03 | 1      | 41         |
| 2020-12-09 | 2      | 27         |
+------------+--------+------------+
Explanation:
Employee 1 has three events: two on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (32 - 4) + (200 - 55) = 173, and one on day 2020-12-03 with a total of (42 - 1) = 41.
Employee 2 has two events: one on day 2020-11-28 with a total of (33 - 3) = 30, and one on day 2020-12-09 with a total of (74 - 47) = 27.
```

# Calculating Total Office Time per Employee per Day

To solve this problem, I need to calculate the total time each employee spent in the office each day by summing up the time differences between their out_time and in_time for all office visits on that day.

## Approach

1. **Group by Employee and Day**: Group records by emp_id and event_day
2. **Calculate Time per Visit**: For each visit, compute out_time - in_time
3. **Sum Daily Time**: Sum these time differences for each employee-day combination
4. **Format Output**: Present results with day, emp_id, and total_time columns

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    event_day AS day,
    emp_id,
    SUM(out_time - in_time) AS total_time
FROM
    Employees
GROUP BY
    emp_id, event_day
ORDER BY
    day, emp_id;
```

## Explanation

1. `GROUP BY emp_id, event_day` creates groups for each employee's daily office visits
2. `SUM(out_time - in_time)` calculates the total time spent by summing individual visit durations
3. The results are ordered by day and then by employee ID
4. In the example:
    - Employee 1 on 2020-11-28: (32-4) + (200-55) = 28 + 145 = 173 minutes
    - Employee 2 on 2020-11-28: 33-3 = 30 minutes
    - Employee 1 on 2020-12-03: 42-1 = 41 minutes
    - Employee 2 on 2020-12-09: 74-47 = 27 minutes

This solution efficiently calculates the required total office times by properly grouping and summing the time differences.
