Table: `Users`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
```

Table: `Register`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
```

Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to **two decimals**.

Return the result table ordered by `percentage` in **descending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `contest_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+
Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+
Output:
+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
Explanation:
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%
```

# Calculating Registration Percentages for Each Contest

To solve this problem, I need to calculate what percentage of total users registered for each contest, then format and order the results appropriately.

## Approach

1. **Count Total Users**: First determine the total number of distinct users in the system
2. **Count Registrations per Contest**: For each contest, count how many users registered
3. **Calculate Percentage**: Divide contest registrations by total users, multiply by 100
4. **Format and Order**: Round to 2 decimals, order by percentage (desc) then contest_id (asc)

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    r.contest_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM
    Register r
GROUP BY
    r.contest_id
ORDER BY
    percentage DESC,
    r.contest_id ASC;
```

## Explanation

1. The subquery `(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Users)` calculates the total number of unique users (3 in the example)
2. For each contest, `COUNT(DISTINCT r.user_id)` counts how many distinct users registered
3. The percentage is calculated by: (contest registrations / total users) × 100
4. `ROUND(..., 2)` formats to 2 decimal places
5. Results are ordered by percentage (highest first), then by contest_id (for ties)
6. In the example:
    - Contests 208, 209, 210: 3/3 users → 100%
    - Contest 215: 2/3 users → 66.67%
    - Contest 207: 1/3 users → 33.33%

This solution efficiently calculates the registration percentages while handling the required formatting and sorting.
