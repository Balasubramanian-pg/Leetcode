Table `Activities`:

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
```

Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by `sell_date`.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output:
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
Explanation:
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

# Grouping Products Sold by Date

To solve this problem, I need to:

1. Group products by their sell date
2. Count the number of distinct products sold each day
3. Create a comma-separated list of product names (sorted alphabetically) for each date
4. Order the results by sell date

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM
    Activities
GROUP BY
    sell_date
ORDER BY
    sell_date;
```

## Explanation

1. **Grouping by Date**: The `GROUP BY sell_date` clause groups all records by their sell date.
2. **Counting Distinct Products**: `COUNT(DISTINCT product)` calculates the number of unique products sold each day.
3. **Concatenating Product Names**:
    - `GROUP_CONCAT` combines all product names into a single string
    - `DISTINCT` ensures each product is listed only once
    - `ORDER BY product` sorts the products alphabetically
    - `SEPARATOR ','` uses commas to separate product names
4. **Ordering Results**: `ORDER BY sell_date` returns dates in chronological order.

For the example input:

- 2020-05-30 has 3 distinct products (Basketball, Headphone, T-Shirt)
- 2020-06-01 has 2 distinct products (Bible, Pencil)
- 2020-06-02 has 1 product (Mask)

The solution handles duplicate products (like Mask appearing twice on 2020-06-02) by using DISTINCT, and formats the output as specified.
