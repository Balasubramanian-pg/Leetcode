Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
```

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of `30` days ending `2019-07-27` inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |

Explanation: Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.

# Finding Daily Active Users for 30 Days Ending 2019-07-27

To solve this problem, I need to count the number of distinct active users for each day in the 30-day period ending on 2019-07-27. A user is considered active on a day if they performed at least one activity on that day.

## Approach

1. **Filter Date Range**: Select activities that occurred between 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27 (30 days ending on 2019-07-27)
2. **Count Distinct Users per Day**: For each day in this period, count the number of unique users who performed at least one activity
3. **Exclude Days with Zero Activity**: Only include days that actually have activity records
4. **Format Output**: Return the date and active user count for each qualifying day

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM
    Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY
    activity_date
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) > 0;
```

## Explanation

- The `DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY)` calculates the start date of the 30-day period (including both start and end dates)
- The `WHERE` clause filters activities to this date range
- `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` counts unique users per day
- `GROUP BY activity_date` groups the results by date
- `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) > 0` ensures we only include days with active users
- In the example:
    - 2019-07-20 has users 1 and 2 active (count = 2)
    - 2019-07-21 has users 2 and 3 active (count = 2)
    - 2019-06-25 is outside our date range and not included

This solution efficiently calculates daily active users while properly handling the date range filtering and distinct user counting.
