Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| reports_to  | int      |
| age         | int      |
+-------------+----------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to. Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null).
```

For this problem, we will consider a **manager** an employee who has at least 1 other employee reporting to them.

Write a solution to report the ids and the names of all **managers**, the number of employees who report **directly** to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| 9           | Hercy   | null       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | null       | 37  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output:
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
| 9           | Hercy | 2             | 39          |
+-------------+-------+---------------+-------------+
Explanation: Hercy has 2 people report directly to him, Alice and Bob. Their average age is (41+36)/2 = 38.5, which is 39 after rounding it to the nearest integer.
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 1           | Michael | null       | 45  |
| 2           | Alice   | 1          | 38  |
| 3           | Bob     | 1          | 42  |
| 4           | Charlie | 2          | 34  |
| 5           | David   | 2          | 40  |
| 6           | Eve     | 3          | 37  |
| 7           | Frank   | null       | 50  |
| 8           | Grace   | null       | 48  |
+-------------+---------+------------+-----+
Output:
+-------------+---------+---------------+-------------+
| employee_id | name    | reports_count | average_age |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1           | Michael | 2             | 40          |
| 2           | Alice   | 2             | 37          |
| 3           | Bob     | 1             | 37          |
+-------------+---------+---------------+-------------+
```

To solve this problem, we need to identify managers (employees who have at least one other employee reporting to them) and report their employee ID, name, the number of direct reports, and the average age of those reports rounded to the nearest integer. The result should be ordered by the employee ID of the managers.

### Approach

1. **Identify Managers and Their Subordinates**: Use a self-join on the Employees table to pair each subordinate with their manager. This is done by joining the table on the condition that the `reports_to` column of a subordinate matches the `employee_id` of the manager.
2. **Group by Manager**: Group the resulting pairs by the manager's employee ID and name to aggregate the data for each manager.
3. **Calculate Metrics**: For each manager, count the number of subordinates and compute the average age of these subordinates, rounding the result to the nearest integer.
4. **Order Results**: Sort the final result by the manager's employee ID to meet the requirement of ordered output.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    m.employee_id,
    m.name,
    COUNT(*) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(e.age)) AS average_age
FROM
    Employees e
JOIN
    Employees m ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
GROUP BY
    m.employee_id, m.name
ORDER BY
    m.employee_id;
```

### Explanation

- **Self-Join**: The self-join (`JOIN Employees m ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id`) pairs each employee (subordinate) with their respective manager. This ensures that only employees with a valid manager (i.e., those with a non-null `reports_to` value) are considered.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: By grouping the results by the manager's employee ID and name, we can aggregate the data to count the number of direct reports and compute the average age of these reports.
- **Rounding**: The `ROUND` function is used to ensure the average age is rounded to the nearest integer, as required by the problem statement.
- **Ordering**: The final result is ordered by the manager's employee ID to meet the specified output format.

This approach efficiently combines the necessary data using a self-join and aggregation, ensuring that only relevant managers are included and the required metrics are accurately computed.
