Table: `Queries`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
Theposition column has a value from1 to500.
Therating column has a value from1 to5. Query withrating less than 3 is a poor query.
```

We define query `quality` as:

> The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define `poor query percentage` as:

> The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each `query_name`, the `quality` and `poor_query_percentage`.

Both `quality` and `poor_query_percentage` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
Output:
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation:
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33
```

# Calculating Query Quality and Poor Query Percentage

To solve this problem, I need to calculate two metrics for each query_name:

1. **Quality**: The average of (rating/position) ratios for all queries of that name
2. **Poor Query Percentage**: The percentage of queries with rating < 3 for that query_name

## Approach

1. **Group by query_name**: Process each query group separately
2. **Calculate Quality**:
    - For each query, compute rating/position
    - Take the average of these values for each query_name
3. **Calculate Poor Query Percentage**:
    - Count queries with rating < 3
    - Divide by total queries for that name
    - Multiply by 100 to get percentage
4. **Round Results**: Round both metrics to 2 decimal places

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND(AVG(rating / position), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
    Queries
GROUP BY
    query_name;
```

## Explanation

- `AVG(rating / position)` calculates the average quality ratio for each query group
- `SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` counts poor queries (rating < 3)
- Multiplying by `100.0 / COUNT(*)` converts this to a percentage
- Both results are rounded to 2 decimal places with `ROUND()`
- For the example:
    - Dog quality: (5/1 + 5/2 + 1/200)/3 = (5 + 2.5 + 0.005)/3 ≈ 2.50
    - Dog poor %: 1 poor query out of 3 → 33.33%
    - Cat quality: (2/5 + 3/3 + 4/7)/3 ≈ (0.4 + 1 + 0.57)/3 ≈ 0.66
    - Cat poor %: 1 poor query out of 3 → 33.33%

This solution efficiently calculates both metrics in a single query with proper grouping and aggregation.
