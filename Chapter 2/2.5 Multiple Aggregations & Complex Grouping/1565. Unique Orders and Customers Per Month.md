**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| customer_id   | int     |
| invoice       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
```

Write a solution to find the number of **unique orders** and the number of **unique customers** with invoices **> $20** for each **different month**.

Return the result table sorted in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | invoice    |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-09-15 | 1           | 30         |
| 2        | 2020-09-17 | 2           | 90         |
| 3        | 2020-10-06 | 3           | 20         |
| 4        | 2020-10-20 | 3           | 21         |
| 5        | 2020-11-10 | 1           | 10         |
| 6        | 2020-11-21 | 2           | 15         |
| 7        | 2020-12-01 | 4           | 55         |
| 8        | 2020-12-03 | 4           | 77         |
| 9        | 2021-01-07 | 3           | 31         |
| 10       | 2021-01-15 | 2           | 20         |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Output:
+---------+-------------+----------------+
| month   | order_count | customer_count |
+---------+-------------+----------------+
| 2020-09 | 2           | 2              |
| 2020-10 | 1           | 1              |
| 2020-12 | 2           | 1              |
| 2021-01 | 1           | 1              |

Explanation:
In September 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers with invoices > $20.
In October 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer, and only one of the two orders has invoice > $20.
In November 2020 we have two orders from 2 different customers but invoices < $20, so we don't include that month.
In December 2020 we have two orders from 1 customer both with invoices > $20.
In January 2021 we have two orders from 2 different customers, but only one of them with invoice > $20.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem where we need to find the number of unique orders and customers with invoices > $20 for each month.

Let's break down the approach:

```SQL
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM Orders
WHERE invoice > 20
GROUP BY month;
```

This solution works in the following way:

1. **Filter the data**: The `WHERE invoice > 20` clause filters out all orders with invoices that are not greater than $20.
2. **Format the date**: `DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')` extracts just the year and month from the full date, in the format 'YYYY-MM' (e.g., '2020-09').
3. **Group by month**: The `GROUP BY month` clause groups all orders from the same month together.
4. **Count orders and customers**:
    - `COUNT(order_id)` counts the number of orders in each month
    - `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` counts the number of unique customers in each month

The result matches the expected output:

- For September 2020, we have 2 orders (IDs 1 and 2) from 2 different customers (IDs 1 and 2), both with invoices > $20
- For October 2020, we have 1 order (ID 4) from 1 customer (ID 3) with invoice > $20
- November 2020 isn't included because no orders have invoices > $20
- For December 2020, we have 2 orders (IDs 7 and 8) from 1 customer (ID 4) with invoices > $20
- For January 2021, we have 1 order (ID 9) from 1 customer (ID 3) with invoice > $20

The MySQL function `DATE_FORMAT()` handles the date formatting, but if you're using a different database system, you might need a different function (e.g., `TO_CHAR` in PostgreSQL or Oracle).
