**Description**

Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
```

Write a solution to find the average number of sessions per user for a period of `30` days ending `2019-07-27` inclusively, **rounded to 2 decimal places**. The sessions we want to count for a user are those with at least one activity in that time period.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | scroll_down   |
| 3       | 5          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
Output:
+---------------------------+
| average_sessions_per_user |
+---------------------------+
| 1.33                      |
+---------------------------+
Explanation: User 1 and 2 each had 1 session in the past 30 days while user 3 had 2 sessions so the average is (1 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1.33.
```

# SQL Challenge: Calculating Average Sessions Per User

Let me guide you through solving this problem step by step, explaining the concepts and SQL techniques needed to arrive at the correct solution.

## Understanding the Problem Requirements

We need to:

1. Find the average number of sessions per user
2. Only consider sessions within a 30-day period ending on 2019-07-27 (inclusive)
3. Round the result to 2 decimal places
4. Count each session only once regardless of how many activities occurred in it

Let's first determine the date range we're interested in:

- End date: 2019-07-27
- Start date: 30 days before = 2019-06-28

## Conceptual Approach

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Filter activities to only those within our date range
2. Count distinct sessions for each user
3. Calculate the average number of sessions across all users

## Step-by-Step Solution Development

### Step 1: Filter Activities Within the Date Range

Our first task is to filter activities that fall within the 30-day window ending on 2019-07-27:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
```

An alternative way to express the same condition using DATEDIFF:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
  AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
```

The second condition (activity_date <= '2019-07-27') might seem redundant, but it ensures we don't include future dates if we were to run this query on a date before 2019-07-27.

### Step 2: Count Distinct Sessions Per User

Next, we count the distinct sessions for each user:

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
GROUP BY user_id
```

This gives us the number of sessions per user within our date range.

### Step 3: Calculate the Average

Now we need to calculate the average of these session counts:

```SQL
WITH UserSessions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
    FROM Activity
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(session_count), 2) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM UserSessions
```

This approach works by:

1. Creating a temporary result set with user_id and their session counts
2. Calculating the average of these session counts
3. Rounding to 2 decimal places

### Complete Solution 1: Using CTE (Common Table Expression)

```SQL
WITH UserSessions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
    FROM Activity
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(session_count), 2) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM UserSessions
```

This solution is clear and follows our logical steps, making it easy to understand and maintain.

### Complete Solution 2: Direct Calculation

There's a more concise approach that calculates the average directly:

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id),
        2
    ) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
```

This solution works by:

1. Counting the total number of distinct sessions
2. Counting the total number of distinct users
3. Dividing these two values to get the average
4. Rounding to 2 decimal places

### Handling Edge Cases: No Data

If there are no users or sessions within our date range, we should return 0 instead of NULL. We can use IFNULL (or COALESCE) to handle this:

```SQL
SELECT
    IFNULL(
        ROUND(
            COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id), 0),
            2
        ),
        0
    ) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM Activity
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
```

The NULLIF function prevents division by zero if there are no users.

## Verification with Example Data

Let's trace through the execution with the provided example data:

1. First, filter by date range (activities between 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27):
    - User 1: 1 session (session_id = 1)
    - User 2: 1 session (session_id = 4)
    - User 3: 2 sessions (session_id = 2 and 5)
    - User 4's session is outside our date range (2019-06-25), so it's excluded
2. Count distinct sessions per user:
    - User 1: 1 session
    - User 2: 1 session
    - User 3: 2 sessions
3. Calculate the average:
    - Average = (1 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1.333...
    - Rounded to 2 decimal places: 1.33

This matches the expected output.

## SQL Optimization Considerations

### Key Performance Factors:

1. **Indexing**: Ensure activity_date is indexed for efficient filtering
2. **Distinct Counts**: COUNT(DISTINCT) operations can be expensive - using subqueries or CTEs might be more efficient for very large datasets
3. **Date Calculations**: DATEDIFF is generally efficient but can have performance implications in very large datasets

### Query Plan Analysis:

For large datasets, the CTE approach might have better query execution plans because:

1. It breaks the problem into smaller steps
2. It allows the optimizer to handle each step separately
3. Intermediate result sets might be smaller and more manageable

## Alternative Approaches

### Using BETWEEN for Date Range

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id),
        2
    ) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
```

Note that we use INTERVAL 29 DAY because BETWEEN is inclusive on both ends.

### Using Subquery Instead of CTE

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(AVG(session_count), 2) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
    FROM Activity
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS UserSessions
```

Functionally equivalent to the CTE approach, but might be more familiar to those who don't use CTEs regularly.

## Final Thoughts

The most elegant solution for this problem is:

```SQL
WITH UserSessions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AS session_count
    FROM Activity
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30
    GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT IFNULL(ROUND(AVG(session_count), 2), 0) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM UserSessions
```

This solution:

1. Clearly expresses the intent of calculating average sessions per user
2. Handles edge cases gracefully
3. Is optimized for readability and maintainability
4. Follows a logical step-by-step approach that matches how we think about the problem

The direct calculation approach is more concise but might be slightly less readable for complex problems. Both approaches are valid and produce the correct result.
