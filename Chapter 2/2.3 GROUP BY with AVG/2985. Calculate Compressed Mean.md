**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+-------------------+------+
| Column Name       | Type |
+-------------------+------+
| order_id          | int  |
| item_count        | int  |
| order_occurrences | int  |
+-------------------+------+
order_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains order_id, item_count, and order_occurrences.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **average** number of items per order, rounded to `2` **decimal places**.

Return _the result table in **any** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------------+
| order_id | item_count | order_occurrences |
+----------+------------+-------------------+
| 10       | 1          | 500               |
| 11       | 2          | 1000              |
| 12       | 3          | 800               |
| 13       | 4          | 1000              |
+----------+------------+-------------------+
Output
+-------------------------+
| average_items_per_order |
+-------------------------+
| 2.70                    |
+-------------------------+
Explanation
The calculation is as follows:
 - Total items: (1 * 500) + (2 * 1000) + (3 * 800) + (4 * 1000) = 8900
 - Total orders: 500 + 1000 + 800 + 1000 = 3300
 - Therefore, the average items per order is 8900 / 3300 = 2.70
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to calculate the average number of items per order based on the given `Orders` table. The table tells us that an order type (`order_id`) with `item_count` items actually occurred `order_occurrences` times.

To find the average number of items per order, we need two things:

1. The total number of items across _all_ orders.
2. The total number of _actual_ orders.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of items. For each row in the `Orders` table, the total items contributed by that specific order type is `item_count * order_occurrences`. To get the grand total items across all order types, we sum these products for every row.

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(item_count * order_occurrences) AS total_items
FROM Orders;
-- This calculates the sum of (items per order type * occurrences of that order type) across all order types.
-- This gives us the total number of individual items sold across all actual orders.
```

Explanation: We use the `SUM()` aggregate function. Inside the sum, we calculate the product of `item_count` and `order_occurrences` for each row. Summing these products gives the total count of all items across all the individual orders represented in the table.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of actual orders. The `order_occurrences` column directly tells us how many times each order type occurred. To get the total number of individual orders, we simply sum the `order_occurrences` for all rows.

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(order_occurrences) AS total_orders
FROM Orders;
-- This calculates the sum of the occurrences for each order type.
-- This gives us the total count of all individual orders.
```

Explanation: We use `SUM(order_occurrences)` to add up the count of how many times each distinct `order_id` entry actually happened as a real order. This gives us the total number of individual orders.

Step 3: Calculate the average by dividing the total items by the total orders. Both sums can be calculated in a single query. We need to ensure the division results in a decimal number, which usually means casting one of the values to a decimal or float type.

```SQL
SELECT
    -- Divide total items by total orders to get the average
    CAST(SUM(item_count * order_occurrences) AS DECIMAL) / SUM(order_occurrences) AS raw_average
FROM Orders;
-- This performs the division of total items by total orders.
-- Casting to DECIMAL ensures that we get a decimal result for the average.
```

Explanation: We combine the two sums from the previous steps into a single query. We divide `SUM(item_count * order_occurrences)` by `SUM(order_occurrences)`. `CAST(... AS DECIMAL)` converts the sum of total items into a decimal number before the division, which forces the division to produce a potentially fractional result, rather than integer division (which would just truncate the decimal part).

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the result to be rounded to 2 decimal places and named `average_items_per_order`.

```SQL
SELECT
    -- Round the calculated average to 2 decimal places
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(item_count * order_occurrences) AS DECIMAL) / SUM(order_occurrences), 2) AS average_items_per_order
FROM Orders;
-- This rounds the average to two decimal places and names the column as required.
```

Explanation: We wrap the entire division calculation in `ROUND(..., 2)`. The `ROUND()` function takes the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places as arguments. We also alias the final calculated column as `average_items_per_order` to match the required output format.

This single query performs all the necessary calculations, handles decimal division, rounds the result, and names the output column correctly.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(item_count * order_occurrences) AS DECIMAL) / SUM(order_occurrences), 2) AS average_items_per_order
FROM Orders;
```
