Table: `Prices`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
```

Table: `UnitsSold`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold.
```

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. `average_price` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+
Output:
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation:
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96
```

# Calculating Average Selling Price for Each Product

To solve this problem, I need to calculate the average selling price for each product by:

1. Matching each sale to its correct price period
2. Calculating the total revenue (price × units) for each product
3. Dividing by the total units sold
4. Handling products with no sales by returning 0

## Approach

1. **Join Tables**: Connect UnitsSold with Prices where purchase_date falls between start_date and end_date
2. **Calculate Revenue**: For each sale, multiply units by the corresponding price
3. **Aggregate by Product**: Sum all revenue and units for each product
4. **Compute Average**: Divide total revenue by total units, rounding to 2 decimal places
5. **Handle Zero Sales**: Use COALESCE to return 0 when no units were sold

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    ROUND(
        COALESCE(
            SUM(p.price * u.units) / NULLIF(SUM(u.units), 0),
            0
        ),
        2
    ) AS average_price
FROM
    Prices p
LEFT JOIN
    UnitsSold u ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
GROUP BY
    p.product_id;
```

## Explanation

- The LEFT JOIN ensures all products from Prices are included, even with no sales
- The BETWEEN condition matches each sale to its correct price period
- SUM(p.price * u.units) calculates total revenue per product
- NULLIF(SUM(u.units), 0) prevents division by zero
- COALESCE returns 0 when there are no sales (NULL result)
- ROUND formats the result to 2 decimal places

For the example:

- Product 1: ((100×5) + (15×20))/115 = 800/115 ≈ 6.96
- Product 2: ((200×15) + (30×30))/230 = 3900/230 ≈ 16.96

This solution efficiently calculates the weighted average price while handling edge cases like products with no sales.
