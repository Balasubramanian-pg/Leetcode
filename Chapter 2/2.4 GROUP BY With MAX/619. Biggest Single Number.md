Table: `MyNumbers`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
```

A **single number** is a number that appeared only once in the `MyNumbers` table.

Find the largest **single number**. If there is no **single number**, report `null`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output:
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.
```

# Finding the Largest Single Number

To solve this problem, I need to identify numbers that appear exactly once in the table (single numbers) and then find the largest one among them. If no single numbers exist, I should return NULL.

## Approach

1. **Identify Single Numbers**: First, find all numbers that appear exactly once by grouping the numbers and counting their occurrences.
2. **Find Maximum Single Number**: From these single numbers, select the maximum value.
3. **Handle NULL Case**: If no single numbers exist, return NULL.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) AS SingleNumbers;
```

## Explanation

1. The inner query groups the numbers and uses `HAVING COUNT(*) = 1` to filter for numbers that appear exactly once.
2. The outer query then selects the maximum value from these single numbers using `MAX(num)`.
3. If there are no single numbers, the subquery will return an empty set, and `MAX()` will naturally return NULL in this case.

For Example 1:

- Single numbers are 1, 4, 5, 6
- The largest is 6, which is returned

For Example 2:

- No single numbers exist
- The query returns NULL as expected

This approach efficiently handles both cases (when single numbers exist and when they don't) while finding the maximum value in a single query.
