```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| user_id       | int      |
| session_start | datetime |
| session_end   | datetime |
| session_id    | int      |
| session_type  | enum     |
+---------------+----------+
session_id is column of unique values for this table.
session_type is an ENUM (category) type of (Viewer, Streamer).
This table contains user id, session start, session end, session id and session type.
```

Return _the result table ordered by count of streaming sessions,_ `user_id` _in **descending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation
- user_id 101, initiated their initial session as a viewer on 2023-11-06 at 13:53:42, followed by two subsequent sessions as a Streamer, the count will be 2.
- user_id 102, although there are two sessions, the initial session was as a Streamer, so this user will be excluded.
- user_id 103 participated in only one session, which was as a Streamer, hence, it won't be considered.
- User_id 104 commenced their first session as a viewer but didn't have any subsequent sessions, therefore, they won't be included in the final count.
Output table is ordered by sessions count and user_id in descending order.
```

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find users who started with a 'Viewer' session and then count how many subsequent sessions they had as a 'Streamer'. We need to output the user ID and this count, ordered by the count descending, then by user ID descending.

We will work with the `Sessions` table. We need to identify the very first session for each user and check its type, and then for qualifying users, count their 'Streamer' sessions.

Step 1: For each user, we need to identify their first session based on the `session_start` time. We can use the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to assign a rank to each session within a user's history, ordered chronologically.

```SQL
WITH RankedSessions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        session_type,
        session_start, -- Keep session_start to verify order
        -- Assign a rank to each session for a user, based on when it started
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY session_start ASC) as rnk
    FROM Sessions
)
-- This CTE calculates a rank for each session a user had, with 1 being the first session chronologically.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RankedSessions`. We select `user_id`, `session_type`, `session_start`, and add a new column `rnk`.

- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER(...)`: Assigns a sequential rank to rows.
- `PARTITION BY user_id`: Ranking restarts for each unique `user_id`.
- `ORDER BY session_start ASC`: Within each user's group, sessions are ordered by their start time from earliest to latest.  
    So,  
    `rnk = 1` identifies the first session for each user, `rnk = 2` is the second, and so on.

Step 2: Now that we've ranked the sessions, we can easily identify the first session for each user (where `rnk = 1`) and check its type. We want to find users whose _first_ session type was 'Viewer'. We'll create another CTE to filter for these users.

```SQL
WITH RankedSessions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
UsersStartingAsViewer AS (
    SELECT
        user_id
    FROM RankedSessions
    WHERE rnk = 1 -- Look at the first session
    AND session_type = 'Viewer' -- Check if the type was 'Viewer'
)
-- This CTE gives us a list of user_ids where the first session they ever had was of type 'Viewer'.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `UsersStartingAsViewer` from the `RankedSessions` CTE. We select the `user_id` where the row's rank (`rnk`) is 1 AND the `session_type` is 'Viewer'. This provides a distinct list of users who started their activity with a viewer session.

Step 3: For the users identified in Step 2, we need to count how many of their sessions were of type 'Streamer'. We can join the original `Sessions` table with the `UsersStartingAsViewer` list. Then, we filter the joined results to keep only 'Streamer' sessions and group by user to count.

```SQL
WITH RankedSessions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
UsersStartingAsViewer AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    -- Count the number of Streamer sessions for these users
    COUNT(s.session_id) AS sessions_count
FROM Sessions s -- Start with all sessions
JOIN UsersStartingAsViewer u ON s.user_id = u.user_id -- Join to include only users from our list
WHERE s.session_type = 'Streamer' -- Keep only the Streamer sessions
GROUP BY s.user_id;
-- This counts the number of 'Streamer' sessions for each user who started with a 'Viewer' session.
-- Users who started as 'Viewer' but had no 'Streamer' sessions will not appear in the result of the JOIN + WHERE s.session_type = 'Streamer', which is correct according to the example.
```

Explanation: We select from the original `Sessions` table (aliased `s`). We `JOIN` it with the `UsersStartingAsViewer` CTE (aliased `u`) on `user_id`. This filters down the sessions to include only those belonging to users whose first session was a viewer session. We then add a `WHERE s.session_type = 'Streamer'` to further filter these sessions, keeping only the streamer ones. Finally, we `GROUP BY s.user_id` and use `COUNT(s.session_id)` to get the total count of streamer sessions for each of these specific users.

Step 4: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `sessions_count` in descending order, and then by `user_id` in descending order for ties.

```SQL
WITH RankedSessions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
UsersStartingAsViewer AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    COUNT(s.session_id) AS sessions_count
FROM Sessions s
JOIN UsersStartingAsViewer u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE s.session_type = 'Streamer'
GROUP BY s.user_id
ORDER BY sessions_count DESC, s.user_id DESC; -- Apply the final ordering
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY sessions_count DESC, s.user_id DESC` at the end of the query to sort the final result set first by the count of streamer sessions from largest to smallest, and then by user ID from largest to smallest for users with the same count.

This query correctly identifies users whose first session was a viewer session, counts their streamer sessions, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedSessions AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        session_type,
        session_start,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY session_start ASC) as rnk
    FROM Sessions
),
UsersStartingAsViewer AS (
    SELECT
        user_id
    FROM RankedSessions
    WHERE rnk = 1
    AND session_type = 'Viewer'
)
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    COUNT(s.session_id) AS sessions_count
FROM Sessions s
JOIN UsersStartingAsViewer u ON s.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE s.session_type = 'Streamer'
GROUP BY s.user_id
ORDER BY sessions_count DESC, s.user_id DESC;
```
