**Description**

Table: `Olympic`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| country       | varchar |
| gold_medals   | int     |
| silver_medals | int     |
| bronze_medals | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL, country is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table shows a country name and the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals it won in the Olympic games.
```

The Olympic table is sorted according to the following rules:

- The country with more gold medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the gold medals, the country with more silver medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the silver medals, the country with more bronze medals comes first.
- If there is a tie in the bronze medals, the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.

Write a solution to sort the Olympic table.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Olympic table:
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| country     | gold_medals | silver_medals | bronze_medals |
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| China       | 10          | 10            | 20            |
| South Sudan | 0           | 0             | 1             |
| USA         | 10          | 10            | 20            |
| Israel      | 2           | 2             | 3             |
| Egypt       | 2           | 2             | 2             |
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| country     | gold_medals | silver_medals | bronze_medals |
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
| China       | 10          | 10            | 20            |
| USA         | 10          | 10            | 20            |
| Israel      | 2           | 2             | 3             |
| Egypt       | 2           | 2             | 2             |
| South Sudan | 0           | 0             | 1             |
+-------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+
Explanation:
The tie between China and USA is broken by their lexicographical names. Since "China" is lexicographically smaller than "USA", it comes first.
Israel comes before Egypt because it has more bronze medals.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to sort the Olympic table according to these rules:
-- 1. More gold medals comes first
-- 2. If gold medals tie, more silver medals comes first
-- 3. If silver medals tie, more bronze medals comes first
-- 4. If bronze medals tie, sort by country name alphabetically
```

Explanation: This problem is asking us to sort the Olympic table based on multiple criteria in a specific order of priority. The sorting rules create a specific ranking system for countries based on their medal counts.

Step 2: Writing the Query with ORDER BY

```SQL
SELECT
    country,
    gold_medals,
    silver_medals,
    bronze_medals
FROM Olympic
ORDER BY gold_medals DESC
```

Explanation: We start with the basic query to select all columns from the Olympic table. Then we add the first sorting criterion: gold medals in descending order (higher count first).

Step 3: Adding Secondary Sorting Criteria

```SQL
SELECT
    country,
    gold_medals,
    silver_medals,
    bronze_medals
FROM Olympic
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC
```

Explanation: Now we add the second sorting criterion: silver medals in descending order. This will be applied when two countries have the same number of gold medals.

Step 4: Adding Tertiary Sorting Criteria

```SQL
SELECT
    country,
    gold_medals,
    silver_medals,
    bronze_medals
FROM Olympic
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC
```

Explanation: We add the third sorting criterion: bronze medals in descending order. This will be applied when two countries have the same number of gold and silver medals.

Step 5: Adding Final Sorting Criteria (Country Name)

```SQL
SELECT
    country,
    gold_medals,
    silver_medals,
    bronze_medals
FROM Olympic
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC,
    country ASC
```

Explanation: Finally, we add the last sorting criterion: country name in alphabetical (ascending) order. This will be applied when two countries have the same number of gold, silver, and bronze medals.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    country,
    gold_medals,
    silver_medals,
    bronze_medals
FROM Olympic
ORDER BY
    gold_medals DESC,
    silver_medals DESC,
    bronze_medals DESC,
    country ASC
```

Explanation: This query selects all columns from the Olympic table and sorts the results according to the specified rules:

1. Countries with more gold medals come first (gold_medals DESC)
2. If there's a tie in gold medals, countries with more silver medals come first (silver_medals DESC)
3. If there's a tie in silver medals, countries with more bronze medals come first (bronze_medals DESC)
4. If there's a tie in bronze medals, countries are sorted alphabetically by name (country ASC)

The query handles all the tie-breaking scenarios correctly, as shown in the example where:

- China and USA (tied in all medals) are sorted alphabetically
- Israel comes before Egypt due to more bronze medals
- South Sudan comes last due to having the least medals
