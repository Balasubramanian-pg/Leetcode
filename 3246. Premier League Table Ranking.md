**Description**

Table: `TeamStats`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| team_id          | int     |
| team_name        | varchar |
| matches_played   | int     |
| wins             | int     |
| draws            | int     |
| losses           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
team_id is the unique key for this table.
This table contains team id, team name, matches_played, wins, draws, and losses.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **points** and **rank** for each team in the league. Points are calculated as follows:

- `3` points for a **win**
- `1` point for a **draw**
- `0` points for a **loss**

**Note:** Teams with the same points must be assigned the same rank.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `points` _in **descending**, and then by_ `team_name` _in **ascending** order._

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`TeamStats` table:

```Plain
+---------+-----------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
| team_id | team_name       | matches_played | wins | draws | losses |
+---------+-----------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
| 1       | Manchester City | 10             | 6    | 2     | 2      |
| 2       | Liverpool       | 10             | 6    | 2     | 2      |
| 3       | Chelsea         | 10             | 5    | 3     | 2      |
| 4       | Arsenal         | 10             | 4    | 4     | 2      |
| 5       | Tottenham       | 10             | 3    | 5     | 2      |
+---------+-----------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------+-----------------+--------+----------+
| team_id | team_name       | points | position |
+---------+-----------------+--------+----------+
| 2       | Liverpool       | 20     | 1        |
| 1       | Manchester City | 20     | 1        |
| 3       | Chelsea         | 18     | 3        |
| 4       | Arsenal         | 16     | 4        |
| 5       | Tottenham       | 14     | 5        |
+---------+-----------------+--------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Manchester City and Liverpool both have 20 points (6 wins * 3 points + 2 draws * 1 point), so they share position 1.
- Chelsea has 18 points (5 wins * 3 points + 3 draws * 1 point) and is position 3rd.
- Arsenal has 16 points (4 wins * 3 points + 4 draws * 1 point) and is position 4th.
- Tottenham has 14 points (3 wins * 3 points + 5 draws * 1 point) and is position 5th.

The output table is ordered by points in descending order, then by team_name in ascending order.

  

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Calculate **points** for each team based on wins, draws, and losses.
2. Assign a **rank** (position) to each team based on their points.
3. Handle ties in points by assigning the same rank to teams with equal points.
4. Order the result by points in descending order, then by team name in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Points calculation:
    - **3 points** for a win.
    - **1 point** for a draw.
    - **0 points** for a loss.
- Use the `RANK()` function to handle ties in points.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Points**

First, calculate the points for each team using the given formula.

```SQL
WITH PointsCalc AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) AS points
    FROM
        TeamStats
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**(wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0)**`: Computes the total points for each team.
- `**PointsCalc**` **CTE**: Stores the calculated points for each team.

---

### **Step 3: Assign Rank (Position)**

Next, assign a rank to each team based on their points. Teams with the same points should have the same rank.

```SQL
, RankedTeams AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        points,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC) AS position
    FROM
        PointsCalc
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)**`: Assigns a rank based on points in descending order.
- Teams with the same points receive the same rank.
- `**RankedTeams**` **CTE**: Stores the team data with their assigned position.

---

### **Step 4: Order the Result**

Finally, order the result by points in descending order, then by team name in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    team_id,
    team_name,
    points,
    position
FROM
    RankedTeams
ORDER BY
    points DESC, team_name ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ORDER BY points DESC, team_name ASC**`: Ensures the result is ordered by points in descending order, then by team name in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH PointsCalc AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) AS points
    FROM
        TeamStats
),
RankedTeams AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        points,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC) AS position
    FROM
        PointsCalc
)
SELECT
    team_id,
    team_name,
    points,
    position
FROM
    RankedTeams
ORDER BY
    points DESC, team_name ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Points Calculation**: Computes the total points for each team.
3. **Ranking**: Assigns a rank based on points, handling ties appropriately.
4. **Ordering**: Ensures the result is ordered correctly.

This query returns the desired output, listing each team’s points and position in the league, ordered by points and team name.
