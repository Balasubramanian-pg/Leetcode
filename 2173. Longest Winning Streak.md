**Description**

Table: `Matches`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| player_id   | int  |
| match_day   | date |
| result      | enum |
+-------------+------+
(player_id, match_day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a player, the day of the match they played, and the result of that match.
The result column is an ENUM (category) type of ('Win', 'Draw', 'Lose').
```

The **winning streak** of a player is the number of consecutive wins uninterrupted by draws or losses.

Write a solution to count the longest winning streak for each player.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Matches table:
+-----------+------------+--------+
| player_id | match_day  | result |
+-----------+------------+--------+
| 1         | 2022-01-17 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-18 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-25 | Win    |
| 1         | 2022-01-31 | Draw   |
| 1         | 2022-02-08 | Win    |
| 2         | 2022-02-06 | Lose   |
| 2         | 2022-02-08 | Lose   |
| 3         | 2022-03-30 | Win    |
+-----------+------------+--------+
Output:
+-----------+----------------+
| player_id | longest_streak |
+-----------+----------------+
| 1         | 3              |
| 2         | 0              |
| 3         | 1              |
+-----------+----------------+
Explanation:
Player 1:
From 2022-01-17 to 2022-01-25, player 1 won 3 consecutive matches.
On 2022-01-31, player 1 had a draw.
On 2022-02-08, player 1 won a match.
The longest winning streak was 3 matches.

Player 2:
From 2022-02-06 to 2022-02-08, player 2 lost 2 consecutive matches.
The longest winning streak was 0 matches.

Player 3:
On 2022-03-30, player 3 won a match.
The longest winning streak was 1 match.
```

**Follow up:** If we are interested in calculating the longest streak without losing (i.e., win or draw), how will your solution change?

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining the logic clearly.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Find the longest winning streak for each player
2. A winning streak is consecutive wins without any draws or losses in between
3. Return the player_id and their longest streak

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Order matches by player and date

First, we need to ensure matches are in chronological order for each player:

```SQL
SELECT
    player_id,
    match_day,
    result
FROM Matches
ORDER BY player_id, match_day;
```

Explanation: This gives us the matches in chronological order for each player, which is necessary to identify consecutive wins.

## Step 2: Identify consecutive wins

To identify consecutive wins, we need to group wins that occur without interruption. One approach is to use a technique called "gaps and islands":

```SQL
WITH OrderedMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY player_id, match_day) AS overall_row_num
    FROM Matches
),
WinMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        overall_row_num,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS win_row_num
    FROM OrderedMatches
    WHERE result = 'Win'
)
```

Explanation: We first assign row numbers to all matches. Then we filter for wins only and assign another row number. The difference between these row numbers will be constant for consecutive wins.

## Step 3: Group consecutive wins

```SQL
WITH OrderedMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY player_id, match_day) AS overall_row_num
    FROM Matches
),
WinMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        overall_row_num,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS win_row_num
    FROM OrderedMatches
    WHERE result = 'Win'
),
WinStreaks AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        overall_row_num - win_row_num AS streak_group,
        COUNT(*) AS streak_length
    FROM WinMatches
    GROUP BY player_id, overall_row_num - win_row_num
)
```

Explanation: We group by the difference between row numbers, which identifies consecutive wins. Then we count the number of wins in each group, giving us the length of each streak.

## Step 4: Find the longest streak for each player

```SQL
WITH OrderedMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY player_id, match_day) AS overall_row_num
    FROM Matches
),
WinMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        overall_row_num,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS win_row_num
    FROM OrderedMatches
    WHERE result = 'Win'
),
WinStreaks AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        overall_row_num - win_row_num AS streak_group,
        COUNT(*) AS streak_length
    FROM WinMatches
    GROUP BY player_id, overall_row_num - win_row_num
),
MaxStreaks AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MAX(streak_length) AS longest_streak
    FROM WinStreaks
    GROUP BY player_id
)
```

Explanation: We calculate the maximum streak length for each player from our streaks.

## Step 5: Include players with no wins

```SQL
SELECT
    p.player_id,
    COALESCE(m.longest_streak, 0) AS longest_streak
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT player_id FROM Matches) p
LEFT JOIN MaxStreaks m ON p.player_id = m.player_id;
```

Explanation: We ensure all players are included, even those without any wins, by using a LEFT JOIN. If a player has no wins, their longest_streak is set to 0.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH OrderedMatches AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS match_num
    FROM Matches
),
GroupedWins AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        match_num,
        match_num - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS win_group
    FROM OrderedMatches
    WHERE result = 'Win'
),
WinStreaks AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        COUNT(*) AS streak_length
    FROM GroupedWins
    GROUP BY player_id, win_group
),
MaxStreaks AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        COALESCE(MAX(streak_length), 0) AS longest_streak
    FROM WinStreaks
    GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT
    p.player_id,
    COALESCE(m.longest_streak, 0) AS longest_streak
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT player_id FROM Matches) p
LEFT JOIN MaxStreaks m ON p.player_id = m.player_id;
```

This query:

1. Orders the matches by player and date
2. Identifies groups of consecutive wins using the "gaps and islands" technique
3. Counts the length of each winning streak
4. Finds the longest streak for each player
5. Ensures all players are included in the result

For the follow-up question: If we're interested in calculating the longest streak without losing (i.e., win or draw), we would modify our solution by changing the filtering condition in the GroupedWins CTE:

```SQL
GroupedWins AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        match_day,
        result,
        match_num,
        match_num - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY match_day) AS win_group
    FROM OrderedMatches
    WHERE result IN ('Win', 'Draw')  -- Change here to include Draw results
)
```

This would count both 'Win' and 'Draw' results as part of the streak, focusing on "not losing" rather than just winning.
