Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) toProduct table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.
```

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.
```

Write a solution to report the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table.

Return the resulting table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------------+-------+-------+
| product_name | year  | price |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Nokia        | 2008  | 5000  |
| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+
Explanation:
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to combine information from the `Sales` and `Product` tables to report the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each `sale_id` in the `Sales` table. The solution involves joining these tables on the `product_id` column and selecting the required columns.

### Approach

1. **Join Tables**: We need to join the `Sales` and `Product` tables on the `product_id` column to combine the sales data with the corresponding product names.
2. **Select Columns**: From the joined table, we select the `product_name` from the `Product` table and the `year` and `price` from the `Sales` table.
3. **Result Order**: The problem statement allows the result to be in any order, so no specific ordering is required in the solution.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    Product.product_name,
    Sales.year,
    Sales.price
FROM Sales
JOIN Product ON Sales.product_id = Product.product_id;
```

### Explanation

- **JOIN Clause**: The `JOIN` operation combines rows from the `Sales` and `Product` tables based on the matching `product_id` values. This allows us to access both the sales details and the corresponding product names in a single query.
- **SELECT Clause**: We select the `product_name` from the `Product` table and the `year` and `price` from the `Sales` table to meet the problem's requirements.
- **Result**: The output includes the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each sale, providing a clear summary of the sales data as requested.

This approach efficiently combines the necessary data from both tables and extracts the required information, offering a straightforward solution to the problem.
