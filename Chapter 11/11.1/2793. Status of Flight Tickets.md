Table: `Flights`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| flight_id   | int  |
| capacity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
flight_id column contains distinct values.
Each row of this table contains flight id and capacity.
```

Table: `Passengers`

```Plain
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| passenger_id | int      |
| flight_id    | int      |
| booking_time | datetime |
+--------------+----------+
passenger_id column contains distinct values.
booking_time column contains distinct values.
Each row of this table contains passenger id, booking time, and their flight id.
```

Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a  
passenger books a ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats  
available on the flight, the passenger's ticket will be **confirmed**. However, the passenger will be on a **waitlist** if the flight is already at full capacity.

Write a solution to determine the current status of flight tickets for each passenger.

Return the result table ordered by `passenger_id` _in **ascending order**._

The result format is in the following example.

+--------------+-----------+
Explanation:
- Flight 1 has a capacity of 2 passengers. Passenger 101 and Passenger 103 were the first to book tickets, securing the available seats. Therefore, their bookings are confirmed. However, Passenger 102 was the third person to book a ticket for this flight, which means there are no more available seats. Passenger 102 is now placed on the waitlist,
- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2 passengers, Flight 2 has exactly two passengers who booked tickets,  Passenger 104 and Passenger 105. Since the number of passengers who booked tickets matches the available seats, both bookings are confirmed.
- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1 passenger. Passenger 107 booked earlier and secured the only available seat, confirming their booking. Passenger 106, who booked after Passenger 107, is on the waitlist.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to determine the status ('Confirmed' or 'Waitlist') for each passenger. A passenger is confirmed if their booking time for a flight is among the earliest bookings up to the flight's capacity. Passengers booking after capacity is reached are on the waitlist.

We have two tables: `Flights` (with `flight_id` and `capacity`) and `Passengers` (with `passenger_id`, `flight_id`, and `booking_time`). The key is the booking order for each flight.

Step 1: We need information from both tables together â€“ specifically, each passenger's details (`passenger_id`, `booking_time`), their flight ID, and that flight's `capacity`. We can combine this information using a `JOIN` on `flight_id`.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.passenger_id,
    p.flight_id,
    p.booking_time,
    f.capacity
FROM Passengers p
JOIN Flights f ON p.flight_id = f.flight_id;
-- This joins passengers with their flight capacity. Now we have all the necessary info in one place.
```

Explanation: We select `passenger_id`, `flight_id`, and `booking_time` from the `Passengers` table (aliased as `p`) and `capacity` from the `Flights` table (aliased as `f`). We join these two tables using `JOIN` on the `flight_id` column, which is common to both.

Step 2: For each flight, we need to rank the passengers based on their `booking_time`. The passenger with the earliest booking time for a flight should get rank 1, the next rank 2, and so on. The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is perfect for this. We'll apply it within each flight (`PARTITION BY flight_id`) and order by `booking_time` ascendingly (earliest first). We'll put the result of Step 1 into a CTE to make it easier to work with.

```SQL
WITH PassengerFlightDetails AS (
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        p.flight_id,
        p.booking_time,
        f.capacity
    FROM Passengers p
    JOIN Flights f ON p.flight_id = f.flight_id
)
SELECT
    passenger_id,
    flight_id, -- Keep for clarity, not in final output
    booking_time, -- Keep for clarity
    capacity, -- Keep for clarity
    -- Assign a rank to each passenger within their flight based on booking time
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY flight_id ORDER BY booking_time ASC) as booking_rank
FROM PassengerFlightDetails;
-- This calculates the booking rank for each passenger on their specific flight.
-- Rank 1 is the earliest booking, Rank 2 is the second earliest, etc.
```

Explanation: We create a CTE `PassengerFlightDetails` from the join result of Step 1. Then, we select from this CTE, adding a new column `booking_rank`.

- `ROW_NUMBER() OVER(...)`: This is a window function that assigns a sequential integer rank to each row within its partition.
- `PARTITION BY flight_id`: This means the ranking restarts for each distinct `flight_id`.
- `ORDER BY booking_time ASC`: Within each flight, rows are ordered by `booking_time` from earliest to latest before ranks are assigned.  
    So,  
    `booking_rank` 1 is the first passenger to book on that flight, 2 is the second, and so on.

Step 3: Now we compare the `booking_rank` of each passenger with the flight's `capacity`.

- If the `booking_rank` is less than or equal to the `capacity`, the passenger is 'Confirmed'.
- If the `booking_rank` is greater than the `capacity`, the passenger is 'Waitlist'.  
    We can use a  
    `CASE` statement to determine the status based on this comparison. We'll wrap the previous step in another CTE.

```SQL
WITH PassengerFlightDetails AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedBookings AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        flight_id,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY flight_id ORDER BY booking_time ASC) as booking_rank
    FROM PassengerFlightDetails
)
SELECT
    passenger_id,
    -- Determine status based on booking rank vs capacity
    CASE
        WHEN booking_rank <= capacity THEN 'Confirmed'
        ELSE 'Waitlist'
    END AS Status
FROM RankedBookings;
-- This assigns 'Confirmed' or 'Waitlist' status to each passenger based on their rank and the flight capacity.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `RankedBookings` from the result of Step 2. We then select `passenger_id` and a new column `Status`. The `CASE` statement checks if the `booking_rank` is less than or equal to the `capacity` for that row. If true, `Status` is 'Confirmed'; otherwise, it's 'Waitlist'.

Step 4: Finally, we need to order the result table by `passenger_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH PassengerFlightDetails AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedBookings AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    passenger_id,
    CASE
        WHEN booking_rank <= capacity THEN 'Confirmed'
        ELSE 'Waitlist'
    END AS Status
FROM RankedBookings
ORDER BY passenger_id ASC; -- Order the final output by passenger ID
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY passenger_id ASC` to the final `SELECT` statement to sort the results by `passenger_id` from smallest to largest.

This query now provides the correct status for each passenger, based on their booking time and flight capacity, and orders the result as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH PassengerFlightDetails AS (
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        p.flight_id,
        p.booking_time,
        f.capacity
    FROM Passengers p
    JOIN Flights f ON p.flight_id = f.flight_id
),
RankedBookings AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        flight_id,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY flight_id ORDER BY booking_time ASC) as booking_rank
    FROM PassengerFlightDetails
)
SELECT
    passenger_id,
    CASE
        WHEN booking_rank <= capacity THEN 'Confirmed'
        ELSE 'Waitlist'
    END AS Status
FROM RankedBookings
ORDER BY passenger_id ASC;
