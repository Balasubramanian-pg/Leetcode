**Description**

Table: `Traffic`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| activity      | enum    |
| activity_date | date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity column is an ENUM (category) type of ('login', 'logout', 'jobs', 'groups', 'homepage').
```

Write a solution to reports for every date within at most `90` days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is `2019-06-30`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Traffic table:
+---------+----------+---------------+
| user_id | activity | activity_date |
+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1       | login    | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | homepage | 2019-05-01    |
| 1       | logout   | 2019-05-01    |
| 2       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 2       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 3       | login    | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | jobs     | 2019-01-01    |
| 3       | logout   | 2019-01-01    |
| 4       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | groups   | 2019-06-21    |
| 4       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-03-01    |
| 5       | login    | 2019-06-21    |
| 5       | logout   | 2019-06-21    |
+---------+----------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+-------------+
| login_date | user_count  |
+------------+-------------+
| 2019-05-01 | 1           |
| 2019-06-21 | 2           |
+------------+-------------+
Explanation:
Note that we only care about dates with non zero user count.
The user with id 5 first logged in on 2019-03-01 so he's not counted on 2019-06-21.
```

# SQL Problem: First Login Date Analysis

I'll solve this problem by breaking it down into clear procedural steps with multiple alternative solutions.

## Problem Analysis

We need to:

1. Find users' first login dates
2. Count users who first logged in on each date
3. Only include dates within 90 days from 2019-06-30
4. Return login_date and user_count

## Solution 1: Using Window Function (Original Solution)

```SQL
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            MIN(activity_date) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS login_date
        FROM Traffic
        WHERE activity = 'login'
    )
SELECT login_date, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count
FROM T
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', login_date) <= 90
GROUP BY 1;
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Filter login activities**: We only care about 'login' events
2. **Find first login date**: Use window function to find earliest login date for each user
3. **Apply date constraint**: Filter to include only dates within 90 days
4. **Group and count**: Aggregate by login date and count distinct users

## Solution 2: Using Subquery with MIN Aggregate

```SQL
SELECT
    first_login AS login_date,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MIN(activity_date) AS first_login
    FROM Traffic
    WHERE activity = 'login'
    GROUP BY user_id
) AS first_logins
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', first_login) <= 90
GROUP BY first_login;
```

### Procedural Decomposition:

1. **Inner query**: Group by user_id and find MIN(activity_date) for login activities
2. **Filter dates**: Apply 90-day window constraint
3. **Aggregate results**: Count users for each login date

## Solution 3: Using ROW_NUMBER()

```SQL
WITH RankedLogins AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        activity_date,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY activity_date) AS login_rank
    FROM Traffic
    WHERE activity = 'login'
)
SELECT
    activity_date AS login_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count
FROM RankedLogins
WHERE login_rank = 1
  AND DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', activity_date) <= 90
GROUP BY activity_date;
```

### Sequential Execution:

1. **Rank login activities**: Assign row numbers to each user's logins ordered by date
2. **Filter first logins**: Keep only rows with login_rank = 1 (first login)
3. **Apply time window**: Filter for dates within 90 days of reference date
4. **Aggregate results**: Group by date and count users

## Solution 4: Using Self-Join Approach

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.activity_date AS login_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t1.user_id) AS user_count
FROM Traffic t1
LEFT JOIN Traffic t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
                    AND t1.activity = 'login'
                    AND t2.activity = 'login'
                    AND t2.activity_date < t1.activity_date
WHERE t1.activity = 'login'
  AND t2.user_id IS NULL
  AND DATEDIFF('2019-06-30', t1.activity_date) <= 90
GROUP BY t1.activity_date;
```

### Logical Workflow:

1. **Self-join setup**: Join Traffic table with itself
2. **Identify first logins**: The LEFT JOIN and NULL check finds records without earlier logins
3. **Apply date filter**: Include only dates within the 90-day window
4. **Aggregate results**: Count distinct users per date

## Solution 5: Most Optimal Approach - Combining CTE with DATE Constraints

```SQL
-- Step 1: Define date constraints
WITH date_parameters AS (
    SELECT
        '2019-06-30' AS today,
        DATE_SUB('2019-06-30', INTERVAL 90 DAY) AS earliest_date
),

-- Step 2: Find each user's first login date
first_logins AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MIN(activity_date) AS login_date
    FROM Traffic
    WHERE activity = 'login'
    GROUP BY user_id
)

-- Step 3: Count users per date within the 90-day window
SELECT
    login_date,
    COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM first_logins, date_parameters
WHERE login_date BETWEEN earliest_date AND today
GROUP BY login_date;
```

### Performance Analysis:

This approach is optimal because:

1. It clearly defines date constraints in a separate CTE
2. Uses straightforward MIN aggregate without window functions
3. Applies date filtering efficiently with BETWEEN
4. Avoids unnecessary DISTINCT operations
5. Uses simple GROUP BY for counting

For this specific problem, Solution 5 provides the best balance of readability, maintainability, and performance.

  

# Alternative Date Functions for the 90-Day Window

Instead of using `BETWEEN '2019-06-30'::DATE - 90 AND '2019-06-30'`, you have several other options to express this 90-day window:

## 1. Using DATE_SUB or DATE_ADD (MySQL)

```SQL
-- MySQL
WHERE first_login_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-06-30', INTERVAL 90 DAY) AND '2019-06-30'
```

## 2. Using DATEADD (SQL Server)

```SQL
-- SQL Server
WHERE first_login_date BETWEEN DATEADD(day, -90, '2019-06-30') AND '2019-06-30'
```

## 3. Using INTERVAL directly (PostgreSQL)

```SQL
-- PostgreSQL
WHERE first_login_date BETWEEN '2019-06-30'::DATE - INTERVAL '90 days' AND '2019-06-30'::DATE
```

## 4. Using arithmetic with CURRENT_DATE (if today was the reference)

```SQL
-- If using current date instead of fixed date
WHERE first_login_date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - 90 AND CURRENT_DATE
```

## 5. Using GENERATE_SERIES for date ranges (PostgreSQL)

```SQL
-- If you need to include all dates in range (even with zero counts)
WITH date_range AS (
  SELECT generate_series(
    '2019-06-30'::DATE - 90,
    '2019-06-30'::DATE,
    '1 day'::INTERVAL
  )::DATE AS login_date
)
SELECT
  dr.login_date,
  COUNT(fl.user_id) AS user_count
FROM
  date_range dr
LEFT JOIN
  FirstLogins fl ON dr.login_date = fl.first_login_date
GROUP BY
  dr.login_date
HAVING
  COUNT(fl.user_id) > 0
```

## 6. Using DATE_TRUNC (if you need month/week boundaries)

```SQL
-- For first day of current month minus 90 days
WHERE first_login_date BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('month', '2019-06-30'::DATE) - INTERVAL '90 days' AND '2019-06-30'::DATE
```

The original approach (`'2019-06-30'::DATE - 90`) is actually very portable and works in:

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL (though INTERVAL is more common)
- SQLite
- Oracle (with slight syntax variation)

Choose the one that best fits your database system and coding standards. The INTERVAL approach is often the most readable as it explicitly states the time unit being subtracted.
