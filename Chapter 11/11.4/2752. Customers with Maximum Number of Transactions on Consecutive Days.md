**Description**

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.
```

Write a solution to find all `customer_id` who made the maximum number of transactions on consecutive days.

Return all `customer_id` with the maximum number of consecutive transactions. Order the result table by `customer_id` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Transactions table:
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | transaction_date | amount |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| 1              | 101         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 2              | 101         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 3              | 101         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
| 4              | 102         | 2023-05-01       | 50     |
| 5              | 102         | 2023-05-03       | 100    |

| 7              | 105         | 2023-05-01       | 100    |
| 8              | 105         | 2023-05-02       | 150    |
| 9              | 105         | 2023-05-03       | 200    |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 101         |
| 105         |
+-------------+
Explanation:
- customer_id 101 has a total of 3 transactions, and all of them are consecutive.
- customer_id 102 has a total of 3 transactions, but only 2 of them are consecutive.
- customer_id 105 has a total of 3 transactions, and all of them are consecutive.
In total, the highest number of consecutive transactions is 3, achieved by customer_id 101 and 105. The customer_id are sorted in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the customer IDs who have the longest streak of transactions on consecutive days. We need to identify all consecutive daily transaction periods for each customer, find the length of the longest period among _all_ customers, and then return the IDs of all customers who had at least one period of that maximum length. The output should be the customer IDs ordered ascendingly.

We will be working with the `Transactions` table. To find consecutive days, we'll need to look at each transaction date relative to the previous one for the same customer.

Step 1: We need to examine each customer's transactions in chronological order. To compare a transaction date with the one immediately before it for the same customer, we can use the `LAG()` window function.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        -- Get the date of the previous transaction for this customer
        LAG(transaction_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_transaction_date
    FROM Transactions
)
-- This first step prepares the data by getting the previous transaction date for each customer's transaction.
-- This is needed to check if the current day is consecutive to the previous one.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `CustomerTransactions`. We select the `customer_id`, `transaction_date`, and add a new column `prev_transaction_date` using `LAG()`.

- `LAG(transaction_date, 1)`: This function looks at the row 1 position before the current row.
- `OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date)`: This specifies the window. `PARTITION BY customer_id` means the `LAG` function operates independently within each customer's set of transactions. `ORDER BY transaction_date` ensures that "previous" means the transaction on the date immediately preceding the current one for that customer.  
    The first transaction for each customer will have  
    `NULL` for `prev_transaction_date`.

Step 2: Now that we have the previous date, we can identify where a sequence of consecutive days _starts_. A new sequence starts if the current transaction is the first for the customer (`prev_transaction_date` is NULL) or if the current date is _not_ exactly one day after the previous transaction date. We can flag these starting points.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        -- Flag indicates the start of a potential new consecutive sequence (1) or continuation (0)
        CASE
            -- If it's the first transaction for the customer OR
            -- the current date is NOT the previous date + 1 day
            WHEN prev_transaction_date IS NULL
                 OR transaction_date <> prev_transaction_date + INTERVAL '1 day' -- Or prev_transaction_date + 1, depending on SQL dialect
            THEN 1 -- Marks the beginning of a new consecutive block
            ELSE 0 -- Marks a continuation of the current block
        END AS is_new_block
    FROM CustomerTransactions
)
-- This CTE flags each transaction row with 1 if it starts a new consecutive block, and 0 if it continues the previous one.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `ConsecutiveFlags`. We select columns from `CustomerTransactions`. The `is_new_block` column uses a `CASE` statement:

- If `prev_transaction_date` is `NULL` (first transaction for the customer), it's the start of the first block, so `is_new_block` is 1.
- Otherwise, it checks if the current `transaction_date` is _not_ exactly one day after `prev_transaction_date`. If it's not, the consecutive sequence is broken, and this transaction starts a new block, so `is_new_block` is 1.
- If `prev_transaction_date` is not NULL AND `transaction_date` _is_ one day after `prev_transaction_date`, it's a continuation of the block, so `is_new_block` is 0.

Step 3: We can now group the consecutive days together. By calculating a cumulative sum of the `is_new_block` flag for each customer, ordered by date, every transaction within the same consecutive block will share the same cumulative sum value. This cumulative sum acts as our group ID for consecutive blocks.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
ConsecutiveGroups AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        -- Calculate a group ID by cumulatively summing the 'is_new_block' flag
        -- The group ID increments whenever a new consecutive block starts
        SUM(is_new_block) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as consecutive_group_id
    FROM ConsecutiveFlags
)
-- This CTE assigns a unique group ID to each consecutive block of transactions for each customer.
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE `ConsecutiveGroups`. We select columns from `ConsecutiveFlags` and calculate `consecutive_group_id`.

- `SUM(is_new_block) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date)`: This is a window function that calculates a running total of the `is_new_block` column. `PARTITION BY customer_id` means the sum resets for each customer. `ORDER BY transaction_date` ensures the sum is calculated in chronological order. Every time `is_new_block` is 1, the sum increases, assigning a new group ID. Every time it's 0, the sum stays the same, keeping the transaction in the current group.

Step 4: Now that we have the transactions grouped into consecutive blocks, we can calculate the length of each block by simply counting the number of transactions within each group.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
ConsecutiveGroups AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
ConsecutiveLengths AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        consecutive_group_id,
        -- Count the number of transactions in each consecutive group
        COUNT(transaction_date) AS sequence_length
    FROM ConsecutiveGroups
    GROUP BY customer_id, consecutive_group_id
)
-- This CTE calculates the number of days (length) for each consecutive transaction block for each customer.
```

Explanation: We create a fourth CTE `ConsecutiveLengths`. We group the data from `ConsecutiveGroups` by `customer_id` and `consecutive_group_id`. For each group, we use `COUNT(transaction_date)` to count how many rows (transactions) are in that group, which gives us the length of that consecutive sequence.

Step 5: We need to find the maximum sequence length found across _all_ customers and all their consecutive periods. We can do this by simply finding the maximum value in the `sequence_length` column from the `ConsecutiveLengths` CTE.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
ConsecutiveGroups AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
ConsecutiveLengths AS ( ... ), -- from step 4
MaxConsecutiveLength AS (
    SELECT
        MAX(sequence_length) AS max_length
    FROM ConsecutiveLengths
)
-- This CTE finds the single highest consecutive sequence length among all customers and all their sequences.
```

Explanation: We create a fifth CTE `MaxConsecutiveLength`. We use the `MAX()` aggregate function on the `sequence_length` column from `ConsecutiveLengths`. Since there's no `GROUP BY`, this returns a single row with the overall maximum length found anywhere in the data.

Step 6: Finally, we select the `customer_id`s from the `ConsecutiveLengths` CTE where the `sequence_length` is equal to the maximum length we found in the `MaxConsecutiveLength` CTE. We need to make sure we return only distinct customer IDs and order them as requested.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
ConsecutiveGroups AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
ConsecutiveLengths AS ( ... ), -- from step 4
MaxConsecutiveLength AS ( ... ) -- from step 5
SELECT DISTINCT -- Ensure we only list each customer ID once
    cl.customer_id
FROM ConsecutiveLengths cl
JOIN MaxConsecutiveLength mcl ON cl.sequence_length = mcl.max_length -- Join to filter for max length
ORDER BY cl.customer_id ASC; -- Order the final result by customer ID
```

Explanation: We select the `customer_id` from the `ConsecutiveLengths` CTE (aliased `cl`). We join it with the `MaxConsecutiveLength` CTE (aliased `mcl`). The join condition `cl.sequence_length = mcl.max_length` filters the results from `ConsecutiveLengths` to keep only those rows representing sequences that match the overall maximum length. `SELECT DISTINCT cl.customer_id` ensures that if a customer had multiple consecutive sequences of the maximum length, their ID is only listed once in the final output. `ORDER BY cl.customer_id ASC` sorts the final list of customer IDs in ascending order.

This query now identifies the customers who achieved the maximum number of consecutive daily transactions and presents their IDs as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        LAG(transaction_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_transaction_date
    FROM Transactions
),
ConsecutiveFlags AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        CASE
            WHEN prev_transaction_date IS NULL
                 OR transaction_date <> prev_transaction_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
            THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_new_block
    FROM CustomerTransactions
),
ConsecutiveGroups AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        SUM(is_new_block) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as consecutive_group_id
    FROM ConsecutiveFlags
),
ConsecutiveLengths AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        consecutive_group_id,
        COUNT(transaction_date) AS sequence_length
    FROM ConsecutiveGroups
    GROUP BY customer_id, consecutive_group_id
),
MaxConsecutiveLength AS (
    SELECT
        MAX(sequence_length) AS max_length
    FROM ConsecutiveLengths
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    cl.customer_id
FROM ConsecutiveLengths cl
JOIN MaxConsecutiveLength mcl ON cl.sequence_length = mcl.max_length
ORDER BY cl.customer_id ASC;
