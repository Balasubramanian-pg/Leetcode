**Description**

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.
```

Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing `amount` for at least three consecutive days. Include the `customer_id`, start  
date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the  
consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive  
transactions by a customer.  

Return _the result table ordered by_ `customer_id, consecutive_start, consecutive_end` _in **ascending** order._

The query result format is in the following example.

Explanation:
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days.
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023.
customer_id is sorted in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to find customers who had transactions for at least three days in a row, _and_ the amount spent increased each day within that consecutive period. We need to report the customer ID and the start and end dates of these qualifying periods.

This problem involves looking at consecutive rows for each customer and checking conditions based on the previous row. This is a perfect use case for window functions.

Step 1: We need to look at each customer's transactions and have them sorted by date. To compare each transaction with the one right before it, we can use a window function called `LAG()`. `LAG()` lets us access data from a previous row within a specified group (partition) and order.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        amount,
        -- Get the transaction date from the previous row for the same customer
        LAG(transaction_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_date,
        -- Get the amount from the previous row for the same customer
        LAG(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_amount
    FROM Transactions
)
-- This first step gets each transaction and the date and amount of the *immediately preceding* transaction for that customer.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `CustomerTransactions`. Inside this CTE, we select the original columns and use `LAG()`.

- `LAG(transaction_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date)`: This gets the `transaction_date` from the row that is 1 position before the current row (`1`) within the group defined by `customer_id` (`PARTITION BY customer_id`), ordered by `transaction_date` (`ORDER BY transaction_date`). The result is named `prev_date`. The first row in each partition will have `NULL` for `prev_date`.
- `LAG(amount, 1) OVER (...)`: Similarly, this gets the `amount` from the previous row and names it `prev_amount`.

Step 2: Now that we have the previous transaction's date and amount, we can check if the current transaction meets the conditions for continuing a "consecutive increasing" sequence. A transaction continues the sequence if:

1. Its date is exactly one day after the previous transaction's date.
2. Its amount is strictly greater than the previous transaction's amount.

We can use a `CASE` statement to flag rows that _break_ this sequence. These flags will help us group the consecutive sequences later.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        amount,
        LAG(transaction_date, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_date,
        LAG(amount, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as prev_amount
    FROM Transactions
),
ConsecutiveFlags AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        amount,
        -- This flag is 1 if the current transaction does NOT continue the consecutive increasing pattern from the previous one.
        -- It's 0 if it *does* continue the pattern.
        CASE
            -- Check if it's NOT the first row for the customer (prev_date IS NOT NULL) AND
            -- the current date is NOT exactly one day after the previous date OR
            -- the current amount is NOT strictly greater than the previous amount.
            WHEN prev_date IS NOT NULL
                 AND (transaction_date <> prev_date + INTERVAL '1 day' OR amount <= prev_amount)
            THEN 1 -- This row breaks or doesn't continue the sequence
            ELSE 0 -- This row continues the sequence (or is the first row for the customer)
        END AS is_break
    FROM CustomerTransactions
)
-- The ConsecutiveFlags CTE identifies where a potential consecutive increasing sequence is broken.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `ConsecutiveFlags`. We select columns from `CustomerTransactions`. The `is_break` column uses a `CASE` statement:

- It checks if `prev_date` is not `NULL` (meaning it's not the very first transaction for the customer).
- It then checks if EITHER the current `transaction_date` is NOT exactly one day after `prev_date` (`transaction_date <> prev_date + INTERVAL '1 day'`) OR the current `amount` is NOT strictly greater than `prev_amount` (`amount <= prev_amount`).
- If _any_ of these conditions (not first row AND (date break OR amount not increasing)) are true, `is_break` is 1. Otherwise, `is_break` is 0. This flag essentially marks the _start_ of a new, potentially unrelated block of transactions (or the end of a previous good block).

Step 3: Now we need to group the consecutive rows where `is_break` was 0. We can do this by calculating a cumulative sum of the `is_break` flag. Every time `is_break` is 1, the cumulative sum increases, assigning a new group ID to the rows that follow until the _next_ break. Rows belonging to the same consecutive increasing block will have the same customer ID and the same cumulative sum value.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
GroupedSequences AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        transaction_date,
        amount,
        -- Calculate a group ID for consecutive sequences.
        -- The ID increments whenever is_break is 1.
        SUM(is_break) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date) as sequence_group_id
    FROM ConsecutiveFlags
)
-- The GroupedSequences CTE assigns a unique group ID to each potential consecutive increasing block for each customer.
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE `GroupedSequences`. We select columns from `ConsecutiveFlags`. The `sequence_group_id` is calculated using a cumulative sum: `SUM(is_break) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY transaction_date)`.

- `PARTITION BY customer_id`: The sum restarts for each customer.
- `ORDER BY transaction_date`: The sum is calculated based on the date order.
- `SUM(is_break)`: Adds up the `is_break` values. When `is_break` is 0 (continuation), the sum doesn't change. When `is_break` is 1 (break/new start), the sum increases by 1, effectively creating a new group ID.

Step 4: We now have our data grouped by `customer_id` and `sequence_group_id` for each potential consecutive increasing block. We need to find the start and end dates of these blocks and count how many transactions are in each block. We then filter to keep only the blocks with at least 3 transactions (which correspond to at least 3 consecutive days).

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
GroupedSequences AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
FilteredSequences AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        sequence_group_id,
        -- Find the start date (min date) and end date (max date) for each group
        MIN(transaction_date) AS consecutive_start,
        MAX(transaction_date) AS consecutive_end,
        -- Count the number of transactions in each group
        COUNT(transaction_date) AS num_days
    FROM GroupedSequences
    GROUP BY customer_id, sequence_group_id
    -- Keep only groups that have at least 3 transactions (days)
    HAVING COUNT(transaction_date) >= 3
)
-- FilteredSequences now contains only the qualifying consecutive increasing periods.
```

Explanation: We create a fourth CTE `FilteredSequences`. We group the results from `GroupedSequences` by `customer_id` and `sequence_group_id`. For each group, we calculate the minimum `transaction_date` (the start of the period), the maximum `transaction_date` (the end of the period), and the count of `transaction_date`s (the number of days in the period). The `HAVING COUNT(transaction_date) >= 3` clause filters out any groups that have fewer than 3 transactions, ensuring we only keep periods of at least three consecutive increasing days.

Step 5: Finally, we select the required columns from the filtered results and apply the final ordering.

```SQL
WITH CustomerTransactions AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
ConsecutiveFlags AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
GroupedSequences AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
FilteredSequences AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
SELECT
    customer_id,
    consecutive_start,
    consecutive_end
FROM FilteredSequences
-- Order the final output as requested
ORDER BY customer_id ASC, consecutive_start ASC, consecutive_end ASC;
```

Explanation: We select the `customer_id`, `consecutive_start`, and `consecutive_end` columns from the `FilteredSequences` CTE. We then add `ORDER BY customer_id ASC, consecutive_start ASC, consecutive_end ASC` to sort the final result set first by customer ID, then by the start date of the consecutive period, and finally by the end date.

This complete query identifies, groups, filters, and formats the data according to the problem's requirements.
