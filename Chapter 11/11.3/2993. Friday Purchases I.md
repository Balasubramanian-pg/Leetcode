+---------------+------+
(user_id, purchase_date, amount_spend) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
purchase_date will range from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, inclusive of both dates.
Each row contains user id, purchase date, and amount spend.

Explanation:
- During the first week of November 2023, transactions amounting to $5,117 occurred on Friday, 2023-11-03.
- For the second week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-10.
- Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-17.
- In the fourth week of November 2023, two transactions took place on Friday, 2023-11-24, amounting to $12,000 and $9,692 respectively, summing up to a total of $21,692.
Output table is ordered by week_of_month in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the total amount spent by users on each Friday in November 2023. We need to report the "week of the month" for that Friday, the specific Friday date, and the total spending on that date. We should only include weeks where at least one purchase occurred on a Friday, and the final result should be ordered by the week of the month.

We will work with the `Purchases` table. We need to filter for Fridays, calculate the week of the month for those Fridays, and then group and sum the spending.

Step 1: We need to filter the transactions to include only those that occurred on a Friday in November 2023. The problem description guarantees the dates are within November 2023. We need to identify Fridays. The method to check for the day of the week varies slightly depending on the specific SQL database system (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). A common way is to check the day of the week number or name. For example, in many systems, Friday corresponds to a specific number (e.g., 6 for `DAYOFWEEK` where Sunday is 1, or 5 for `EXTRACT(DOW FROM date)` where Sunday is 0). Let's assume `DAYOFWEEK` where Friday is 6 for the explanation.

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    purchase_date,
    amount_spend
FROM Purchases
WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6; -- Assuming DAYOFWEEK returns 6 for Friday
-- This filters the purchases table to include only transactions that happened on a Friday.
```

Explanation: We select the relevant columns from the `Purchases` table. The `WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6` clause filters the rows to keep only those where the `purchase_date` falls on a Friday. Note that the specific function and the number for Friday might differ slightly in different SQL dialects.

Step 2: For each Friday purchase date, we need to figure out which "week of the month" it belongs to. The problem defines weeks relative to the start of November 2023. Since November 1st, 2023, was a Wednesday, the weeks are defined as: Nov 1-3 (Week 1), Nov 4-10 (Week 2), Nov 11-17 (Week 3), Nov 18-24 (Week 4), Nov 25-30 (Week 5). We can calculate this week number based on the day of the month. A formula like `FLOOR((DAY(purchase_date) - 1) / 7) + 1` works well here.

```SQL
WITH FridayPurchases AS (
    SELECT
        user_id, -- Keep for now, not needed in final sum
        purchase_date,
        amount_spend,
        -- Calculate the week number within November based on the day of the month
        FLOOR((DAY(purchase_date) - 1) / 7) + 1 AS week_of_month
    FROM Purchases
    WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6 -- Still filtering for Fridays
)
-- This CTE includes all Friday purchases and calculates which week of November each Friday falls into.
```

Explanation: We create a CTE `FridayPurchases` from the results of Step 1. We add a new column `week_of_month`.

- `DAY(purchase_date)`: Extracts the day number (1-30) from the date.
- `DAY(purchase_date) - 1`: Gets the day number minus 1 (0-29).
- `(DAY(purchase_date) - 1) / 7`: Divides by 7. For days 0-6 (Nov 1-7), this is 0.something. For days 7-13 (Nov 8-14), this is 1.something, etc.
- `FLOOR(...)`: Rounds down to the nearest integer. So, days 1-7 get 0, days 8-14 get 1, etc.
- `... + 1`: Adds 1 to make the week numbers 1-indexed (Week 1, Week 2, ...).  
    This correctly assigns the week number based on 7-day blocks starting from day 1 of the month.  
    

Step 3: Now that we have the `week_of_month` and the `purchase_date` (which is guaranteed to be a Friday for these rows), we can group by these two columns and sum the `amount_spend` for each group.

```SQL
WITH FridayPurchases AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    week_of_month,
    purchase_date,
    -- Sum the amount spent for all purchases on this specific Friday
    SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
FROM FridayPurchases
-- Group by the calculated week number and the specific Friday date
GROUP BY week_of_month, purchase_date;
-- This groups the Friday purchases by their week and date, and calculates the total spending for each Friday.
```

Explanation: We select `week_of_month`, `purchase_date`, and the sum of `amount_spend` (aliased as `total_amount`) from the `FridayPurchases` CTE. We use `GROUP BY week_of_month, purchase_date`. This groups all rows with the same calculated week number and the same specific purchase date (which will be the same date for a given week) together and calculates the total spending for that group. Because we filtered for Fridays in the CTE, we are guaranteed that `purchase_date` will be a Friday, and grouping by both `week_of_month` and `purchase_date` correctly aggregates spending for each unique Friday date.

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the result table to be ordered by `week_of_month` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH FridayPurchases AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    week_of_month,
    purchase_date,
    SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
FROM FridayPurchases
GROUP BY week_of_month, purchase_date
ORDER BY week_of_month ASC; -- Order the final output by week number
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY week_of_month ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final results based on the calculated week number from smallest to largest. Since we only process rows that _are_ Friday purchases, the grouping and selection naturally only output weeks that had at least one such purchase.

This query correctly filters for Friday purchases, calculates the week of the month, aggregates the spending per Friday, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH FridayPurchases AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        purchase_date,
        amount_spend,
        FLOOR((DAY(purchase_date) - 1) / 7) + 1 AS week_of_month
    FROM Purchases
    WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6 -- Assuming DAYOFWEEK returns 6 for Friday. Adjust for other SQL dialects if needed.
)
SELECT
    week_of_month,
    purchase_date,
    SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
FROM FridayPurchases
GROUP BY week_of_month, purchase_date
ORDER BY week_of_month ASC;
```
