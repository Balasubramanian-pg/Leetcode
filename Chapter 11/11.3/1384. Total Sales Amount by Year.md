**Description**

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
product_name is the name of the product.
```

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| product_id          | int     |
| period_start        | date    |
| period_end          | date    |
| average_daily_sales | int     |
+---------------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
period_start and period_end indicate the start and end date for the sales period, and both dates are inclusive.
The average_daily_sales column holds the average daily sales amount of the items for the period.
The dates of the sales years are between 2018 to 2020.
```

Write a solution to report the total sales amount of each item for each year, with corresponding `product_name`, `product_id`, `report_year`, and `total_amount`.

Return the result table **ordered** by `product_id` and `report_year`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | LC Phone     |
| 2          | LC T-Shirt   |
| 3          | LC Keychain  |
+------------+--------------+
Sales table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+---------------------+
| product_id | period_start | period_end  | average_daily_sales |
+------------+--------------+-------------+---------------------+
| 1          | 2019-01-25   | 2019-02-28  | 100                 |
| 2          | 2018-12-01   | 2020-01-01  | 10                  |
| 3          | 2019-12-01   | 2020-01-31  | 1                   |
+------------+--------------+-------------+---------------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name | report_year | total_amount |
+------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | LC Phone     |    2019     | 3500         |
| 2          | LC T-Shirt   |    2018     | 310          |
| 2          | LC T-Shirt   |    2019     | 3650         |
| 2          | LC T-Shirt   |    2020     | 10           |
| 3          | LC Keychain  |    2019     | 31           |
| 3          | LC Keychain  |    2020     | 31           |
+------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
LC Phone was sold for the period of 2019-01-25 to 2019-02-28, and there are 35 days for this period. Total amount 35*100 = 3500.
LC T-shirt was sold for the period of 2018-12-01 to 2020-01-01, and there are 31, 365, 1 days for years 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.
LC Keychain was sold for the period of 2019-12-01 to 2020-01-31, and there are 31, 31 days for years 2019 and 2020 respectively.
```

## Solutions

This problem requires us to calculate total sales amounts by product and year, breaking down periods that span multiple years. Let me analyze the solution in detail.

## Problem Analysis

We need to:

1. Match product IDs with product names
2. Break down sales periods into yearly components (2018-2020)
3. Calculate the total sales amount for each product in each year
4. Order results by product_id and report_year

## Key Challenge

The main complexity is handling sales periods that span across multiple years. For example, if a product is sold from December 2018 to January 2020, we need to split this into:

- Partial period in 2018 (Dec 1 - Dec 31)
- Full period in 2019 (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
- Partial period in 2020 (Jan 1 - Jan 1)

## Solution Approach

To solve this, we need to:

1. Generate a list of all possible report years (2018, 2019, 2020)
2. Join this with the sales data
3. Calculate the overlap between each sales period and each year
4. Multiply the days in each overlap by the average daily sales

Here's the solution:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE YearTable AS (
    SELECT 2018 AS report_year
    UNION ALL
    SELECT report_year + 1
    FROM YearTable
    WHERE report_year < 2020
),
SalesPerYear AS (
    SELECT
        s.product_id,
        y.report_year,
        s.average_daily_sales,
        GREATEST(s.period_start, STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(y.report_year, '-01-01'), '%Y-%m-%d')) AS start_date,
        LEAST(s.period_end, STR_TO_DATE(CONCAT(y.report_year, '-12-31'), '%Y-%m-%d')) AS end_date
    FROM
        Sales s
        JOIN YearTable y ON y.report_year BETWEEN YEAR(s.period_start) AND YEAR(s.period_end)
)
SELECT
    spy.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    spy.report_year,
    spy.average_daily_sales * (DATEDIFF(spy.end_date, spy.start_date) + 1) AS total_amount
FROM
    SalesPerYear spy
    JOIN Product p ON spy.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY
    spy.product_id,
    spy.report_year;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create Year Range (YearTable CTE)**:
    - Uses a recursive CTE to generate years 2018, 2019, and 2020
2. **Calculate Sales by Year (SalesPerYear CTE)**:
    - Joins the sales data with the years table
    - Filters to include only years that overlap with sales periods
    - Calculates the start and end dates for each year's portion:
        - `start_date`: The later of (period_start, January 1 of the year)
        - `end_date`: The earlier of (period_end, December 31 of the year)
3. **Calculate Total Amount**:
    - Joins with the Product table to get product names
    - Calculates total amount as:  
          
        `average_daily_sales * (days in period for that year)`
    - The `DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) + 1` gives the number of days (inclusive of both start and end dates)
4. **Sort Results**:
    - Orders by product_id and report_year as required

## Example Walkthrough

For LC Phone (product_id = 1):

- Period: 2019-01-25 to 2019-02-28
- Only overlaps with 2019
- Days: DATEDIFF('2019-02-28', '2019-01-25') + 1 = 35 days
- Total: 35 * 100 = 3,500

For LC T-Shirt (product_id = 2):

- Period: 2018-12-01 to 2020-01-01
- Overlaps with:
    - 2018: 2018-12-01 to 2018-12-31 = 31 days → 31 * 10 = 310
    - 2019: 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31 = 365 days → 365 * 10 = 3,650
    - 2020: 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-01 = 1 day → 1 * 10 = 10

This approach correctly handles all edge cases, including leap years and partial periods, by calculating the exact date ranges for each year.
