You are the business owner and would like to obtain a sales report for category items and the day of the week.

Write a solution to report how many units in each category have been ordered on each **day of the week**.

Return the result table **ordered** by `category`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
On Monday (2020-06-01, 2020-06-08) were sold a total of 20 units (10 + 10) in the category Book (ids: 1, 2).
On Tuesday (2020-06-02) were sold a total of 5 units in the category Book (ids: 1, 2).
On Wednesday (2020-06-03) were sold a total of 5 units in the category Phone (ids: 3, 4).
On Thursday (2020-06-04) were sold a total of 1 unit in the category Phone (ids: 3, 4).
On Friday (2020-06-05) were sold 10 units in the category Book (ids: 1, 2) and 5 units in Glasses (ids: 5).
On Saturday there are no items sold.
On Sunday (2020-06-14, 2020-06-21) were sold a total of 10 units (5 +5) in the category Phone (ids: 3, 4).
There are no sales of T-shirts.
```

## Solutions

I'll create a SQL solution to generate a sales report showing how many units in each category have been ordered on each day of the week.

For this problem, we need to:

1. Join the Orders and Items tables
2. Convert order_date to day of week
3. Calculate total quantity for each category and day of week
4. Include all categories and days of week in the results, even if there are no orders
5. Order the results by category

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    i.item_category AS Category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 2 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Monday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 3 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Tuesday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 4 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Wednesday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 5 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Thursday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 6 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Friday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 7 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Saturday,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(o.order_date) = 1 THEN o.quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Sunday
FROM
    Items i
LEFT JOIN
    Orders o ON i.item_id = o.item_id
GROUP BY
    i.item_category
ORDER BY
    i.item_category;
```

This solution:

1. Uses LEFT JOIN to include all categories from the Items table, even if there are no orders
2. Uses DAYOFWEEK function to determine the day of week (1=Sunday, 2=Monday, etc.)
3. Uses conditional SUM with CASE expressions to pivot the data and calculate totals for each day
4. Groups by item_category to get totals for each category
5. Orders by item_category as required

Note on MySQL's DAYOFWEEK function:

- 1 = Sunday
- 2 = Monday
- 3 = Tuesday
- 4 = Wednesday
- 5 = Thursday
- 6 = Friday
- 7 = Saturday

This will produce the expected output showing total quantities for each category and day of the week.
