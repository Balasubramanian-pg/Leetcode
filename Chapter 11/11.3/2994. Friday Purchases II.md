**Description**

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| user_id       | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
| amount_spend  | int  |
+---------------+------+
(user_id, purchase_date, amount_spend) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
purchase_date will range from November 1, 2023, to November 30, 2023, inclusive of both dates.
Each row contains user id, purchase date, and amount spend.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **total spending** by users on **each Friday** of **every week** in **November 2023**. If there are **no** purchases on a particular **Friday of a week**, it will be considered as `0`.

Return _the result table ordered by week of month in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Purchases table:
+---------+---------------+--------------+
| user_id | purchase_date | amount_spend |
+---------+---------------+--------------+
| 11      | 2023-11-07    | 1126         |
| 15      | 2023-11-30    | 7473         |

+---------+---------------+--------------+
Output:
+---------------+---------------+--------------+
| week_of_month | purchase_date | total_amount |
+---------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1             | 2023-11-03    | 5117         |

| 4             | 2023-11-24    | 21692        |
+---------------+---------------+--------------+
Explanation:
- During the first week of November 2023, transactions amounting to $5,117 occurred on Friday, 2023-11-03.
- For the second week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-10, resulting in a value of 0 in the output table for that day.
- Similarly, during the third week of November 2023, there were no transactions on Friday, 2023-11-17, reflected as 0 in the output table for that specific day.
- In the fourth week of November 2023, two transactions took place on Friday, 2023-11-24, amounting to $12,000 and $9,692 respectively, summing up to a total of $21,692.
Output table is ordered by week_of_month in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the total spending on each Friday in November 2023. This is similar to a previous problem, but with a key difference: we must include _all_ Fridays in November, even if there were no purchases on that specific Friday, in which case the total spending should be 0. The output should be the week of the month, the Friday date, and the total spending, ordered by the week of the month.

We will work with the `Purchases` table, but we also need a way to represent the Fridays in November that might _not_ be in the `Purchases` table.

Step 1: Identify all the Fridays in November 2023 and determine their corresponding "week of the month" number according to the rule (Week 1: Nov 1-6, Week 2: Nov 7-12, etc.). Since the date range is fixed and small (Nov 1-30, 2023), we can list these specific Fridays and their week numbers directly. November 2023's Fridays were 2023-11-03, 2023-11-10, 2023-11-17, and 2023-11-24.

```SQL
WITH AllFridaysInNov AS (
    -- Explicitly list the Fridays in November and their week numbers
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
)
-- This CTE creates a list of all the Fridays in November that we need to report on,
-- along with their calculated week number.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `AllFridaysInNov`. We use `UNION ALL` to combine four separate `SELECT` statements, each providing one Friday date in November and its corresponding week number based on the problem's definition (Nov 1-6 is week 1, Nov 7-12 is week 2, etc.). This gives us a complete list of the target dates and their week numbers, regardless of whether any purchases occurred on those dates.

Step 2: Calculate the total spending from the `Purchases` table, but only for transactions that occurred on a Friday. We group the `Purchases` data by the `purchase_date` (which will be a Friday) and sum the `amount_spend`.

```SQL
WITH AllFridaysInNov AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
FridayPurchasesTotal AS (
    SELECT
        purchase_date,
        SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
    FROM Purchases
    -- Filter purchases to only include Fridays.
    WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6 -- Assuming DAYOFWEEK returns 6 for Friday. Adjust for other SQL dialects if needed (e.g., EXTRACT(DOW FROM purchase_date) = 5).
    GROUP BY purchase_date
)
-- This CTE calculates the total amount spent for each specific Friday that had purchases.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `FridayPurchasesTotal`. We select the `purchase_date` and `SUM(amount_spend)` from the `Purchases` table. The `WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6` filters the rows to only include those that occurred on a Friday (adjust the day of week check based on your specific SQL database if `DAYOFWEEK = 6` isn't correct for Friday). We then `GROUP BY purchase_date` to sum the spending for each individual Friday date that had transactions.

Step 3: Combine the complete list of Fridays (from `AllFridaysInNov`) with the calculated total spending on those Fridays (from `FridayPurchasesTotal`). We use a `LEFT JOIN` starting from `AllFridaysInNov` to ensure that all Fridays are included. If a Friday from `AllFridaysInNov` does not have a matching date in `FridayPurchasesTotal` (meaning no purchases occurred on that Friday), the `total_amount` will be `NULL`. We replace this `NULL` with 0 using `COALESCE()`.

```SQL
WITH AllFridaysInNov AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
FridayPurchasesTotal AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    af.week_of_month, -- Get the week number from our list of Fridays
    af.friday_date, -- Get the date from our list of Fridays
    -- Get the total spending from the purchases, or 0 if no purchases on that date
    COALESCE(fpt.total_amount, 0) AS total_amount
FROM AllFridaysInNov af -- Start with the complete list of Fridays
LEFT JOIN FridayPurchasesTotal fpt ON af.friday_date = fpt.purchase_date; -- Join with calculated spending
-- This LEFT JOIN ensures all Fridays from AllFridaysInNov are included. COALESCE handles cases with no purchases.
```

Explanation: We select from the `AllFridaysInNov` CTE (aliased `af`). We `LEFT JOIN` it with the `FridayPurchasesTotal` CTE (aliased `fpt`) on the date columns (`af.friday_date = fpt.purchase_date`). A `LEFT JOIN` keeps all rows from the "left" table (`AllFridaysInNov`). For Fridays that had purchases, the matching row from `FridayPurchasesTotal` is included. For Fridays that had no purchases, `fpt.total_amount` will be `NULL`. `COALESCE(fpt.total_amount, 0)` replaces `NULL` with 0. The column is aliased as `total_amount`.

Step 4: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `week_of_month` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH AllFridaysInNov AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
FridayPurchasesTotal AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    af.week_of_month,
    af.friday_date AS purchase_date, -- Alias date column as required
    COALESCE(fpt.total_amount, 0) AS total_amount
FROM AllFridaysInNov af
LEFT JOIN FridayPurchasesTotal fpt ON af.friday_date = fpt.purchase_date
ORDER BY af.week_of_month ASC; -- Order the final output by week number
```

Explanation: We alias `af.friday_date` to `purchase_date` as required by the output format. We add `ORDER BY af.week_of_month ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final results based on the calculated week number from smallest to largest.

This query generates the necessary Friday dates, calculates spending only for days with purchases, joins the two sets to ensure all Fridays are represented (with 0 spending if needed), and orders the result correctly.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH AllFridaysInNov AS (
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-03' AS friday_date, 1 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-10' AS friday_date, 2 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-17' AS friday_date, 3 AS week_of_month UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2023-11-24' AS friday_date, 4 AS week_of_month
),
FridayPurchasesTotal AS (
    SELECT
        purchase_date,
        SUM(amount_spend) AS total_amount
    FROM Purchases
    WHERE DAYOFWEEK(purchase_date) = 6 -- Assuming DAYOFWEEK returns 6 for Friday. Adjust for other SQL dialects if needed.
    GROUP BY purchase_date
)
SELECT
    af.week_of_month,
    af.friday_date AS purchase_date,
    COALESCE(fpt.total_amount, 0) AS total_amount
FROM AllFridaysInNov af
LEFT JOIN FridayPurchasesTotal fpt ON af.friday_date = fpt.purchase_date
ORDER BY af.week_of_month ASC;
```
