**Description**

Table: Heights

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| height      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table, and it is guaranteed to be in sequential order.
Each row of this table contains an id and height.
```

Write a solution to calculate the amount of rainwater can be **trapped between the bars** in the landscape, considering that each bar has a **width** of `1` unit.

Return _the result table in_ **any** _order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Heights table:
+-----+--------+
| id  | height |
+-----+--------+
| 1   | 0      |
| 2   | 1      |
| 3   | 0      |
| 4   | 2      |
| 5   | 1      |
| 6   | 0      |
| 7   | 1      |
| 8   | 3      |
| 9   | 2      |
| 10  | 1      |
| 11  | 2      |
| 12  | 1      |
+-----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| total_trapped_water |
+---------------------+
| 6                   |
+---------------------+
Explanation:

The elevation map depicted above (in the black section) is graphically represented with the x-axis denoting the id and the y-axis representing the heights [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this scenario, 6 units of rainwater are trapped within the blue section.

## Solutions

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars represented by the `height` values in the `Heights` table.

### **Concept:**

The amount of rainwater that can be trapped above each bar depends on the height of the tallest bars to its left and right. Specifically:

- For each bar, the water that can be trapped above it is determined by the smaller of the maximum height to its left and right minus the height of the bar itself.
- If the height of the bar is greater than or equal to the smaller maximum of the left and right heights, no water can be trapped above it.

### **Approach:**

1. **Calculate the Maximum Heights on Left and Right**:
    - For each bar, calculate the maximum height on its left side (`left_max`).
    - For each bar, calculate the maximum height on its right side (`right_max`).
2. **Calculate Water Trapped Above Each Bar**:
    - For each bar, the trapped water is the difference between the smaller of the left and right maximum heights and the current height.
    - If the minimum of the left and right maximum heights is greater than the current height, the water trapped is this difference. Otherwise, no water is trapped.
3. **Sum the Trapped Water**:
    - Sum the water trapped at each bar to get the total amount of rainwater trapped.

### **SQL Solution:**

We can use **window functions** in SQL to calculate the left and right maximum heights efficiently.

### **SQL Query**:

```SQL
WITH MaxHeights AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        height,
        -- Calculate maximum height to the left of the current bar
        MAX(height) OVER (PARTITION BY 1 ORDER BY id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS left_max,
        -- Calculate maximum height to the right of the current bar
        MAX(height) OVER (PARTITION BY 1 ORDER BY id DESC ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS right_max
    FROM Heights
)

SELECT
    SUM(
        -- Water trapped is the minimum of left_max and right_max minus the height of the current bar
        GREATEST(LEAST(left_max, right_max) - height, 0)
    ) AS total_trapped_water
FROM MaxHeights;
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **MaxHeights CTE**:
    - This Common Table Expression (CTE) computes the `left_max` and `right_max` values for each bar.
        - `left_max` is the maximum height from the beginning to the current bar.
        - `right_max` is the maximum height from the current bar to the end.
    - The `PARTITION BY 1` in the window function ensures that the maximum height calculation is done for the entire table without any partitioning (i.e., over the whole dataset).
2. **Trapping Water**:
    - For each bar, we calculate the trapped water as the difference between the minimum of `left_max` and `right_max` minus the current bar's height. The `GREATEST` function ensures that negative values are replaced with `0`, as no negative trapped water is possible.
3. **Total Trapped Water**:
    - We sum the trapped water across all bars to get the total amount of rainwater.

### **Example Walkthrough**:

For the input:

```Plain
+-----+--------+
| id  | height |
+-----+--------+
| 1   | 0      |
| 2   | 1      |
| 3   | 0      |
| 4   | 2      |
| 5   | 1      |
| 6   | 0      |
| 7   | 1      |
| 8   | 3      |
| 9   | 2      |
| 10  | 1      |
| 11  | 2      |
| 12  | 1      |
+-----+--------+
```

The process calculates the total trapped water as **6** units.

### **Result**:

```Plain
+---------------------+
| total_trapped_water |
+---------------------+
| 6                   |
+---------------------+
```

This solution efficiently calculates the trapped rainwater by using window functions to determine the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar, then computes the trapped water accordingly.
