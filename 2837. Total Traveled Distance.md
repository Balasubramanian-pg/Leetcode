**Description**

Table: `Users`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains user id and name.
```

Table: `Rides`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| ride_id      | int  |
| user_id      | int  |
| distance     | int  |
+--------------+------+
ride_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains ride id, user id, and traveled distance.
```

Write a solution to calculate the `distance` traveled by **each user**. If there is a user who hasn't completed any rides, then their `distance` should be considered as `0`. Output the `user_id`, `name` and total traveled `distance`.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

| 4       | Michael |
| 2       | Avery   |
| 10      | Eleanor |
+---------+---------+
Rides table:
+---------+---------+----------+

| 10      | Eleanor | 0                 |
| 14      | Ethan   | 186               |

+---------+---------+-------------------+
Explanation:
-  User id 2 completed two journeys of 197 and 196, resulting in a combined travel distance of 393.
-  User id 4 completed two journeys of 59 and 357, resulting in a combined travel distance of 416.
-  User id 14 completed two journeys of 161 and 25, resulting in a combined travel distance of 186.
-  User id 16 completed only one journey of 160.
-  User id 10 did not complete any journeys, thus the total travel distance remains at 0.
Returning the table orderd by user_id in ascending order.
```

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the total distance traveled by every user. A key requirement is to include users who have taken no rides and show their total distance as 0. We need to output the user ID, their name, and their total distance, ordered by user ID.

We have two tables: `Users` (with `user_id` and `name`) and `Rides` (with `ride_id`, `user_id`, and `distance`).

Step 1: We need to start with the `Users` table because the problem asks for the distance for _each_ user, including those who haven't taken any rides.

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    name
FROM Users;
-- This selects all users and their names from the Users table.
```

Explanation: This is the starting point. It simply lists all users, ensuring we include everyone before considering their rides.

Step 2: Now, we need to connect the user information with their ride information from the `Rides` table. Since a user might not have any rides, we must use a `LEFT JOIN` from the `Users` table to the `Rides` table on the `user_id`. This way, all users from the `Users` table are kept, and matching ride details from `Rides` are brought in (or `NULL`s if there are no matching rides).

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    r.distance -- Include distance to see how it joins
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id;
-- This joins users with their rides. Users without rides will have NULL in the distance column.
```

Explanation: We select from the `Users` table, giving it the alias `u`. We then use `LEFT JOIN` to connect it to the `Rides` table (aliased `r`) based on the `user_id` being the same in both tables. The `LEFT JOIN` means all rows from `Users` (the "left" table) are included. If a user has rides, the corresponding `distance` from `Rides` is included. If a user has no rides, they are still included, but the columns from `Rides` (like `r.distance`) will be `NULL`.

Step 3: We need to calculate the _total_ distance for each user. Since a user can have multiple rides, we need to sum the `distance` for all rides associated with each user. We do this by grouping the results from the join by `user_id` and `name` (since `name` is unique for each `user_id`).

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    SUM(r.distance) AS total_distance -- Calculate the sum of distances per user
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name;
-- This groups the joined data by user and calculates the total distance by summing up their ride distances.
```

Explanation: We group the results of the `LEFT JOIN` by `u.user_id` and `u.name`. The `SUM(r.distance)` aggregate function calculates the sum of the `distance` values for all the rows within each group (each user). If a user had no rides (and thus `r.distance` was `NULL` in the joined rows), `SUM(NULL)` or `SUM()` over no rows results in `NULL`.

Step 4: As mentioned, `SUM()` will result in `NULL` for users with no rides. The problem requires this to be 0. We can use the `COALESCE()` function to replace any `NULL` sum with 0.

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS total_distance -- Replace NULL sum with 0
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name;
-- This ensures that users with no rides show a total distance of 0 instead of NULL.
```

Explanation: We wrap the `SUM(r.distance)` calculation with `COALESCE(..., 0)`. `COALESCE()` returns the first non-NULL value in its list. So, if `SUM(r.distance)` is `NULL` (for users with no rides), it will return 0 instead. Otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.

Step 5: The final output column for the total distance needs to be named `traveled distance`. We just need to adjust the alias.

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS "traveled distance" -- Alias the column as required
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name;
-- The column name is updated to match the required output format. Double quotes are often needed for names with spaces.
```

Explanation: We change the alias `total_distance` to `"traveled distance"`. It's good practice to put column names with spaces in double quotes.

Step 6: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS "traveled distance"
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name
ORDER BY u.user_id ASC; -- Order the result by user ID
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY u.user_id ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final results based on the `user_id` column from smallest to largest.

This query now correctly calculates the total distance for every user, includes users with zero distance, and formats and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS "traveled distance"
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name
ORDER BY u.user_id ASC;
```
