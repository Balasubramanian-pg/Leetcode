Write a solution to find the students who have **taken all courses** offered in their `major` and have achieved a **grade of A in all these courses**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `student_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

students table:

```Plain
+------------+------------------+------------------+
| student_id | name             | major            |
+------------+------------------+------------------+
| 1          | Alice            | Computer Science |

```

**Explanation:**

- Alice (student_id 1) is a Computer Science major and has taken both "Algorithms" and "Data Structures", receiving an 'A' in both.
- Bob (student_id 2) is a Computer Science major but did not receive an 'A' in all required courses.
- Charlie (student_id 3) is a Mathematics major and has taken both "Calculus" and "Linear Algebra", receiving an 'A' in both.
- David (student_id 4) is a Mathematics major but did not receive an 'A' in all required courses.

**Note:** Output table is ordered by student_id in ascending order.

## Solutions

Let’s break down the solution step-by-step, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find students who:

1. Have taken **all courses** offered in their major.
2. Have achieved a grade of **A** in **all** these courses.

**Key Points:**

1. Identify all courses for each major.
2. Check which students have enrolled in all courses of their major.
3. Verify that these students received an **A** in every course.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Courses for Each Major**

First, list all courses for each major.

```SQL
SELECT
    major,
    COUNT(course_id) AS total_courses
FROM
    courses
GROUP BY
    major;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**GROUP BY major**`: Groups courses by major.
- `**COUNT(course_id)**`: Counts the number of courses for each major.

---

### **Step 3: Count Courses Taken by Each Student**

Next, count how many courses each student has taken in their major.

```SQL
SELECT
    s.student_id,
    s.major,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken
FROM
    students s
JOIN
    enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN
    courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE
    c.major = s.major
GROUP BY
    s.student_id, s.major;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**JOIN enrollments**`: Links students to their enrollments.
- `**JOIN courses**`: Links enrollments to courses.
- `**WHERE c.major = s.major**`: Filters courses to match the student’s major.
- `**COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id)**`: Counts unique courses taken by each student.

---

### **Step 4: Verify All Courses Are Taken with Grade A**

Now, verify that the student has taken **all** courses in their major and received an **A** in each.

```SQL
SELECT
    s.student_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken_with_A
FROM
    students s
JOIN
    enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN
    courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE
    c.major = s.major
    AND e.grade = 'A'
GROUP BY
    s.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**WHERE e.grade = 'A'**`: Filters for courses with grade **A**.
- `**COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id)**`: Counts courses with grade **A**.

---

### **Step 5: Combine and Filter Results**

Combine the counts of total courses and courses taken with grade **A**, then filter students who meet both criteria.

```SQL
WITH CourseCounts AS (
    SELECT
        s.major,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.course_id) AS total_courses
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        courses c ON s.major = c.major
    GROUP BY
        s.major
),
StudentCourses AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        s.major,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id, s.major
),
StudentGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken_with_A
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND e.grade = 'A'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
)
SELECT
    sc.student_id
FROM
    StudentCourses sc
JOIN
    CourseCounts cc ON sc.major = cc.major
JOIN
    StudentGrades sg ON sc.student_id = sg.student_id
WHERE
    sc.courses_taken = cc.total_courses
    AND sc.courses_taken = sg.courses_taken_with_A
ORDER BY
    sc.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1. `**CourseCounts**`: Counts total courses for each major.
2. `**StudentCourses**`: Counts courses taken by each student in their major.
3. `**StudentGrades**`: Counts courses taken with grade **A**.
4. **Final** `**SELECT**`: Joins all CTEs and filters students who took all courses with grade **A**.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH CourseCounts AS (
    SELECT
        major,
        COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) AS total_courses
    FROM
        courses
    GROUP BY
        major
),
StudentCourses AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
),
StudentGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS courses_taken_with_A
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND e.grade = 'A'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
)
SELECT
    sc.student_id
FROM
    StudentCourses sc
JOIN
    CourseCounts cc ON sc.major = cc.major
JOIN
    StudentGrades sg ON sc.student_id = sg.student_id
WHERE
    sc.courses_taken = cc.total_courses
    AND sc.courses_taken = sg.courses_taken_with_A
ORDER BY
    sc.student_id;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Joins**: Combine data from multiple tables.
3. **Filters**: Ensure students meet both criteria (all courses taken and all grades **A**).
4. **Order**: Sorts the result by `student_id`.

This query returns the `student_id` of students who took all courses in their major with grade **A**, ordered by `student_id`.
