Table: `Insurance`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| pid         | int   |
| tiv_2015    | float |
| tiv_2016    | float |
| lat         | float |
| lon         | float |
+-------------+-------+
pid is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one policy where:
pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lat is not NULL.
lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city. It's guaranteed that lon is not NULL.
```

Write a solution to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 `tiv_2016`, for all policyholders who:

- have the same `tiv_2015` value as one or more other policyholders, and
- are not located in the same city as any other policyholder (i.e., the (`lat, lon`) attribute pairs must be unique).

Round `tiv_2016` to **two decimal places**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Insurance table:
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| pid | tiv_2015 | tiv_2016 | lat | lon |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
| 1   | 10       | 5        | 10  | 10  |
| 2   | 20       | 20       | 20  | 20  |
| 3   | 10       | 30       | 20  | 20  |
| 4   | 10       | 40       | 40  | 40  |
+-----+----------+----------+-----+-----+
Output:
+----------+
| tiv_2016 |
+----------+
| 45.00    |
+----------+
Explanation:
The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
```

# Solution to Calculate Insurance Investment Values

To solve this problem, I need to identify policyholders who meet two specific criteria and then sum their 2016 investment values.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
WITH SameTiv2015 AS (
    SELECT pid
    FROM Insurance
    WHERE tiv_2015 IN (
        SELECT tiv_2015
        FROM Insurance
        GROUP BY tiv_2015
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    )
),
UniqueLocations AS (
    SELECT pid
    FROM Insurance
    GROUP BY lat, lon
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)
SELECT ROUND(SUM(i.tiv_2016), 2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance i
WHERE i.pid IN (SELECT pid FROM SameTiv2015)
AND i.pid IN (SELECT pid FROM UniqueLocations);
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **First CTE (SameTiv2015)**:
    - Identifies policyholders whose 2015 investment value appears more than once
    - Uses a subquery to find tiv_2015 values with count > 1
    - Returns pids of policyholders sharing tiv_2015 values
2. **Second CTE (UniqueLocations)**:
    - Identifies policyholders with unique (lat, lon) pairs
    - Groups by latitude and longitude
    - Only keeps locations that appear exactly once
3. **Main Query**:
    - Joins the Insurance table with both CTEs
    - Only includes policyholders who appear in both CTEs
    - Sums their tiv_2016 values
    - Rounds the result to 2 decimal places

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data:

- Policy 1: tiv_2015=10 (shared with 3,4), location (10,10) unique
- Policy 2: tiv_2015=20 (unique), location (20,20) shared with 3
- Policy 3: tiv_2015=10 (shared with 1,4), location (20,20) shared with 2
- Policy 4: tiv_2015=10 (shared with 1,3), location (40,40) unique

Qualifying policies:

- Policy 1: meets both criteria (shared tiv_2015, unique location)
- Policy 4: meets both criteria (shared tiv_2015, unique location)

Sum of tiv_2016: 5 (policy 1) + 40 (policy 4) = 45.00

The solution correctly identifies and sums only the qualifying policies.
