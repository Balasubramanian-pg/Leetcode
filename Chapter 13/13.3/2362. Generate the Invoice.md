**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
product_id contains unique values.
Each row in this table shows the ID of a product and the price of one unit.
```

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(invoice_id, product_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table shows the quantity ordered from one product in an invoice.
```

Write a solution to show the details of the invoice with  
the highest price. If two or more invoices have the same price, return  
the details of the one with the smallest  
`invoice_id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 100   |
| 2          | 200   |
+------------+-------+
Purchases table:
+------------+------------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | quantity |
+------------+------------+----------+
| 1          | 1          | 2        |
| 3          | 2          | 1        |
| 2          | 2          | 3        |
| 2          | 1          | 4        |
| 4          | 1          | 10       |
+------------+------------+----------+
Output:
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | quantity | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 2          | 3        | 600   |
| 1          | 4        | 400   |
+------------+----------+-------+
Explanation:
Invoice 1: price = (2 * 100) = $200
Invoice 2: price = (4 * 100) + (3 * 200) = $1000
Invoice 3: price = (1 * 200) = $200
Invoice 4: price = (10 * 100) = $1000

The highest price is $1000, and the invoices with the highest prices are 2 and 4. We return the details of the one with the smallest ID, which is invoice 2.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to find the invoice with the highest total price
-- Total price = sum of (quantity * price) for all products in the invoice
-- If there's a tie for highest price, take the invoice with the smallest invoice_id
-- Return product_id, quantity, and price for all products in that invoice
```

Explanation: This problem requires calculating the total price for each invoice, finding the invoice with the highest total price (or the lowest invoice_id in case of a tie), and returning the details of all products in that invoice.

Step 2: Calculate Total Price for Each Invoice

```SQL
SELECT
    p.invoice_id,
    SUM(p.quantity * pr.price) as total_price
FROM Purchases p
JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
GROUP BY p.invoice_id
```

Explanation: First, we join the Purchases and Products tables to get the price for each product. Then we group by invoice_id and calculate the total price for each invoice by summing up (quantity * price) for all products in that invoice.

Step 3: Find the Invoice with the Highest Price

```SQL
WITH InvoicePrices AS (
    SELECT
        p.invoice_id,
        SUM(p.quantity * pr.price) as total_price
    FROM Purchases p
    JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
    GROUP BY p.invoice_id
)
SELECT invoice_id
FROM InvoicePrices
ORDER BY total_price DESC, invoice_id ASC
LIMIT 1
```

Explanation: Using our previous calculation as a Common Table Expression (CTE), we can now find the invoice with the highest total price. We order the results by total_price in descending order (highest first), and then by invoice_id in ascending order (lowest first) to handle ties. Then we limit the result to 1 row to get only the invoice we're looking for.

Step 4: Get the Details of All Products in the Selected Invoice

```SQL
WITH InvoicePrices AS (
    SELECT
        p.invoice_id,
        SUM(p.quantity * pr.price) as total_price
    FROM Purchases p
    JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
    GROUP BY p.invoice_id
),
HighestInvoice AS (
    SELECT invoice_id
    FROM InvoicePrices
    ORDER BY total_price DESC, invoice_id ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.quantity,
    p.quantity * pr.price as price
FROM Purchases p
JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
JOIN HighestInvoice hi ON p.invoice_id = hi.invoice_id
```

Explanation: Now we join our HighestInvoice CTE with the Purchases and Products tables to get the details of all products in the selected invoice. For each product, we include the product_id, quantity, and the calculated price (quantity * unit price).

Step 5: Final Solution

```SQL
WITH InvoicePrices AS (
    SELECT
        p.invoice_id,
        SUM(p.quantity * pr.price) as total_price
    FROM Purchases p
    JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
    GROUP BY p.invoice_id
),
HighestInvoice AS (
    SELECT invoice_id
    FROM InvoicePrices
    ORDER BY total_price DESC, invoice_id ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.quantity,
    p.quantity * pr.price as price
FROM Purchases p
JOIN Products pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
JOIN HighestInvoice hi ON p.invoice_id = hi.invoice_id
```

Explanation: The final solution:

1. Calculates the total price for each invoice by summing up (quantity * price) for all products
2. Identifies the invoice with the highest total price (or the smallest invoice_id in case of a tie)
3. Returns the details (product_id, quantity, and price) for all products in that invoice

This SQL query correctly handles the case where multiple invoices have the same highest price by selecting the one with the smallest invoice_id, as required by the problem statement.
