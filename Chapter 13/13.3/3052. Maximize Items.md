**Description**

Table: `Inventory`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| item_id        | int     |
| item_type      | varchar |
| item_category  | varchar |
| square_footage | decimal |
+----------------+---------+
item_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row includes item id, item type, item category and sqaure footage.
```

Leetcode warehouse wants to maximize the number of items it can stock in a `500,000` square feet warehouse. It wants to stock as many **prime** items as possible, and afterwards use the **remaining** square footage to stock the most number of **non-prime** items.

Write a solution to find the number of **prime** and **non-prime** items that can be **stored** in the `500,000` square feet warehouse. Output the item type with `prime_eligible` followed by `not_prime` and the maximum number of items that can be stocked.

**Note:**

- Item **count** must be a whole number (integer).
- If the count for the **not_prime** category is `0`, you should **output** `0` for that particular category.

Return _the result table ordered by item count in **descending order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Inventory table:
+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+
| item_id | item_type      | item_category | square_footage |
+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+
| 1374    | prime_eligible | Watches       | 68.00          |
| 4245    | not_prime      | Art           | 26.40          |
| 5743    | prime_eligible | Software      | 325.00         |
| 8543    | not_prime      | Clothing      | 64.50          |
| 2556    | not_prime      | Shoes         | 15.00          |
| 2452    | prime_eligible | Scientific    | 85.00          |
| 3255    | not_prime      | Furniture     | 22.60          |
| 1672    | prime_eligible | Beauty        | 8.50           |
| 4256    | prime_eligible | Furniture     | 55.50          |
| 6325    | prime_eligible | Food          | 13.20          |
+---------+----------------+---------------+----------------+
Output:
+----------------+-------------+
| item_type      | item_count  |
+----------------+-------------+
| prime_eligible | 5400        |
| not_prime      | 8           |
+----------------+-------------+
Explanation:
- The prime-eligible category comprises a total of 6 items, amounting to a combined square footage of 555.20 (68 + 325 + 85 + 8.50 + 55.50 + 13.20). It is possible to store 900 combinations of these 6 items, totaling 5400 items and occupying 499,680 square footage.
- In the not_prime category, there are a total of 4 items with a combined square footage of 128.50. After deducting the storage used by prime-eligible items (500,000 - 499,680 = 320), there is room for 2 combinations of non-prime items, accommodating a total of 8 non-prime items within the available 320 square footage.
Output table is ordered by item count in descending order.
```

### Problem Understanding (Plain English)

We are asked to calculate how many items can be stored in a 500,000 square feet warehouse by prioritizing:

1. As **many** `**prime_eligible**` **items as possible** first.
2. Then using the **remaining space for** `**not_prime**` **items**.

We need to return:

- The type of item (`prime_eligible`, `not_prime`)
- The total number of items that can be stored
- Sort the results by item count in descending order.

We'll solve this step-by-step.

---

## Step 1: Separate Prime and Non-Prime Items and Sort by Size

```SQL
SELECT item_type, square_footage
FROM Inventory
ORDER BY
  CASE WHEN item_type = 'prime_eligible' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END,
  square_footage
```

**Explanation:**

We first sort all items by item_type (`prime_eligible` first) and by smallest item size. Smaller items mean more fit into the warehouse.

---

## Step 2: Rank Items by Type and Order

```SQL
SELECT
  item_id,
  item_type,
  square_footage,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    PARTITION BY item_type
    ORDER BY square_footage
  ) AS rn
FROM Inventory
```

**Explanation:**

We assign a row number to each item within each type (prime and non-prime) in order of increasing square footage.

This step helps simulate combinations and makes further logic manageable, but to _actually solve the problem_ we need **aggregations** to simulate storing multiple sets of prime items.

---

## Step 3: Pre-Aggregate Prime and Not-Prime Item Combinations

```SQL
WITH prime_items AS (
  SELECT square_footage
  FROM Inventory
  WHERE item_type = 'prime_eligible'
),
not_prime_items AS (
  SELECT square_footage
  FROM Inventory
  WHERE item_type = 'not_prime'
),
prime_stats AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS item_count,
    SUM(square_footage) AS total_space
  FROM prime_items
),
max_prime_fit AS (
  SELECT
    FLOOR(500000 / total_space) AS combo_count
  FROM prime_stats
),
prime_total AS (
  SELECT
    'prime_eligible' AS item_type,
    combo_count * item_count AS item_count,
    combo_count * total_space AS used_space
  FROM max_prime_fit, prime_stats
),
not_prime_total AS (
  SELECT
    'not_prime' AS item_type,
    CASE
      WHEN SUM(square_footage) = 0 THEN 0
      ELSE FLOOR((500000 - used_space) / SUM(square_footage))
    END * COUNT(*) AS item_count
  FROM Inventory, prime_total
  WHERE item_type = 'not_prime'
)
SELECT item_type, item_count
FROM (
  SELECT item_type, item_count FROM prime_total
  UNION ALL
  SELECT item_type, item_count FROM not_prime_total
) AS final_result
ORDER BY item_count DESC
```

---

**Explanation of Steps:**

1. `prime_items` and `not_prime_items`: Split the table.
2. `prime_stats`: Count how many prime items and their total size.
3. `max_prime_fit`: Figure out how many full combinations of all prime items can fit.
4. `prime_total`: Multiply that count to get total prime items and total space used.
5. `not_prime_total`: Use remaining space to fit as many non-prime item sets as possible.
6. Combine and sort.

### Final Solution

```SQL
WITH prime_items AS (
  SELECT square_footage
  FROM Inventory
  WHERE item_type = 'prime_eligible'
),
not_prime_items AS (
  SELECT square_footage
  FROM Inventory
  WHERE item_type = 'not_prime'
),
prime_stats AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS item_count,
    SUM(square_footage) AS total_space
  FROM prime_items
),
max_prime_fit AS (
  SELECT
    FLOOR(500000 / total_space) AS combo_count
  FROM prime_stats
),
prime_total AS (
  SELECT
    'prime_eligible' AS item_type,
    combo_count * item_count AS item_count,
    combo_count * total_space AS used_space
  FROM max_prime_fit, prime_stats
),
not_prime_total AS (
  SELECT
    'not_prime' AS item_type,
    CASE
      WHEN SUM(square_footage) = 0 THEN 0
      ELSE FLOOR((500000 - used_space) / SUM(square_footage))
    END * COUNT(*) AS item_count
  FROM Inventory, prime_total
  WHERE item_type = 'not_prime'
)
SELECT item_type, item_count
FROM (
  SELECT item_type, item_count FROM prime_total
  UNION ALL
  SELECT item_type, item_count FROM not_prime_total
) AS final_result
ORDER BY item_count DESC
```

Let me know if you'd like me to break this into more granular sub steps or simulate it on a smaller dataset.
