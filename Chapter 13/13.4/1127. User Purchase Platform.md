**Description**

Table: `Spending`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| spend_date  | date    |
| platform    | enum    |
| amount      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
The table logs the history of the spending of users that make purchases from an online shopping website that has a desktop and a mobile application.
(user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
The platform column is an ENUM (category) type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
```

Write a solution to find the total number of users and the  
total amount spent using the mobile only, the desktop only, and both  
mobile and desktop together for each date.  

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Spending table:
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+

    ```
    

# Comprehensive SQL Solution: User Platform Spending Analysis

I'll walk you through solving this SQL problem step by step, developing a solution that handles the nuances of tracking user spending across different platforms.

## 1. Problem Analysis and Requirements

Let's break down what we need to accomplish:

1. **Group data by date and platform type**: We need to show spending by date and platform category (desktop-only, mobile-only, or both).
2. **Calculate total amounts and users**: For each date and platform combination, we need the total amount spent and total users.
3. **Handle "both" as a category**: When a user uses both platforms on the same day, we must include them in a special "both" category.
4. **Include zero values**: Even if no users fall into a category on a given date, we need to display rows with zeros.

The challenge here is that "both" isn't in the original data - we need to derive it by finding users who have transactions on both platforms on the same day.

## 2. Conceptual Solution Design

We need to:

1. Identify users who use only a single platform vs. both platforms on each date
2. Create a complete set of date/platform combinations including "both"
3. Calculate aggregate values for each combination

## 3. Step-by-Step Solution Development

### Step 1: Identify Users' Platform Usage Patterns by Date

We need to classify each user's daily activity:

```SQL
WITH UserPlatforms AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) AS amount,
        -- Group by user and date, then determine platform category
        CASE
            WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1 THEN MAX(platform) -- Single platform
            ELSE 'both' -- Multiple platforms
        END AS platform
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
)
```

This gives us:

```Plain
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | both     | 200    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
```

### Step 2: Create Complete Date/Platform Combinations

We need all possible combinations of dates and platforms ('desktop', 'mobile', 'both'):

```SQL
WITH AllDates AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date FROM Spending
),
AllPlatforms AS (
    SELECT 'desktop' AS platform
    UNION SELECT 'mobile' AS platform
    UNION SELECT 'both' AS platform
),
DatePlatformCombinations AS (
    SELECT
        d.spend_date,
        p.platform
    FROM AllDates d
    CROSS JOIN AllPlatforms p
)
```

This gives us all possible combinations:

```Plain
+------------+----------+
| spend_date | platform |
+------------+----------+
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   |
| 2019-07-01 | both     |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   |
| 2019-07-02 | both     |
+------------+----------+
```

### Step 3: Combine User Data with All Combinations

Now we'll join our user platforms data with all combinations and calculate aggregates:

```SQL
WITH UserPlatforms AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) AS amount,
        CASE
            WHEN COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1 THEN MAX(platform)
            ELSE 'both'
        END AS platform
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
),
DatePlatformCombinations AS (
    -- As defined in Step 2
)

SELECT
    dp.spend_date,
    dp.platform,
    IFNULL(SUM(up.amount), 0) AS total_amount,
    COUNT(up.user_id) AS total_users
FROM DatePlatformCombinations dp
LEFT JOIN UserPlatforms up
    ON dp.spend_date = up.spend_date
    AND dp.platform = up.platform
GROUP BY dp.spend_date, dp.platform
ORDER BY dp.spend_date, dp.platform;
```

## 4. Complete Optimized Solution

Here's the complete solution with optimized syntax:

```SQL
WITH UserDailyPlatforms AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
        -- Classify user's platform usage for the day
        IF(COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1, MAX(platform), 'both') AS platform
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
),

AllPossibleCombinations AS (
    -- Generate all date-platform combinations
    SELECT
        d.spend_date,
        p.platform
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT spend_date FROM Spending) d
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 'desktop' AS platform
        UNION SELECT 'mobile'
        UNION SELECT 'both'
    ) p
)

-- Final aggregation with complete result set
SELECT
    c.spend_date,
    c.platform,
    IFNULL(SUM(u.total_amount), 0) AS total_amount,
    COUNT(u.user_id) AS total_users
FROM
    AllPossibleCombinations c
    LEFT JOIN UserDailyPlatforms u
        ON c.spend_date = u.spend_date
        AND c.platform = u.platform
GROUP BY
    c.spend_date,
    c.platform;
```

## 5. Execution Flow Analysis

Let's walk through the execution for our example data:

### First CTE (UserDailyPlatforms):

- Group by user_id and spend_date
- Determine platform category based on distinct platform count
- Sum amounts for each user-date-platform combination

For 2019-07-01:

- User 1: Used both platforms, total amount = 200
- User 2: Used mobile only, total amount = 100
- User 3: Used desktop only, total amount = 100

For 2019-07-02:

- User 2: Used mobile only, total amount = 100
- User 3: Used desktop only, total amount = 100

### Second CTE (AllPossibleCombinations):

- Create all date-platform combinations (6 total)

### Final Query:

- Join combinations with actual user data
- Aggregate amounts and count users
- Use IFNULL to ensure zeros instead of NULLs
- Group by date and platform

## 6. Alternative Approaches

### Alternative 1: Using MySQL's IF Instead of CASE

```SQL
WITH UserPlatforms AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) AS amount,
        IF(COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1, MAX(platform), 'both') AS platform
    FROM Spending
    GROUP BY user_id, spend_date
)
```

### Alternative 2: Using Built-in MySQL Functions

For MySQL we can simplify with:

```SQL
WITH DatePlatforms AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT spend_date FROM Spending
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 'desktop' AS platform
        UNION SELECT 'mobile'
        UNION SELECT 'both'
    ) p
)
```

### Alternative 3: Using Advanced Window Functions

```SQL
WITH UserDaily AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        SUM(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, spend_date) as total_daily_amount,
        COUNT(DISTINCT platform) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, spend_date) as platform_count,
        platform
    FROM Spending
),
UserClassified AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        user_id,
        spend_date,
        CASE WHEN platform_count = 1 THEN platform ELSE 'both' END as platform,
        total_daily_amount
    FROM UserDaily
    WHERE (platform_count = 1) OR (platform_count > 1 AND platform = (
        SELECT MIN(platform) FROM UserDaily ud WHERE ud.user_id = UserDaily.user_id AND ud.spend_date = UserDaily.spend_date
    ))
)
```

However, this approach is more complex and may not be as performant.

## 7. Performance Considerations

### Query Execution Flow:

1. **First CTE Pass**: O(n) to scan the Spending table
2. **Grouping Operation**: Hash aggregation for user_id and spend_date
3. **Cross Join**: Creates a small result set (dates × 3 platforms)
4. **Final Join**: Hash join between the cross product and aggregated data
5. **Final Aggregation**: Hash aggregation by date and platform

### Index Recommendations:

- Primary key on (user_id, spend_date, platform) already exists
- Consider an index on (spend_date, platform, amount) to optimize the aggregation

### Optimizations:

1. **Use IF instead of CASE** for simpler, more readable code
2. **IFNULL for zero handling** ensures clean output without NULL values
3. **Minimize the cross join** by generating only necessary date-platform combinations

## 8. Validation Against Expected Output

For 2019-07-01:

- Desktop only: User 3 = 100 amount, 1 user
- Mobile only: User 2 = 100 amount, 1 user
- Both platforms: User 1 = 200 amount, 1 user

For 2019-07-02:

- Desktop only: User 3 = 100 amount, 1 user
- Mobile only: User 2 = 100 amount, 1 user
- Both platforms: No users = 0 amount, 0 users

This matches our expected output exactly.

## 9. Real-World Applications of This Pattern

This SQL pattern (aggregating by multiple categories with derived groupings) appears in many business scenarios:

1. **Customer channel analysis**: Understanding buying behavior across website, mobile app, and physical stores
2. **Marketing campaign effectiveness**: Comparing engagement across email, social media, and other channels
3. **Product feature usage**: Analyzing which features users engage with on an application

The core technique of:

1. First classifying individual behaviors
2. Then creating a complete set of all possible combinations
3. Finally joining and aggregating

Is a powerful SQL pattern you can apply to many analytical problems.

## 10. Final Thoughts and Takeaways

The key insight in this problem is recognizing the need to:

1. First transform the data to identify platform usage patterns by user and date
2. Create a complete set of all possible output combinations
3. Join these together to ensure a complete result set with zeros where appropriate

This approach handles multi-dimensional categorization elegantly and ensures no combinations are missing in the output.
