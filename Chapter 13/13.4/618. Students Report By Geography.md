**Description**

Table: `Student`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the continent they came from.
```

A school has students from Asia, Europe, and America.

Write a solution to [pivot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) the continent column in the `Student` table so that each name is **sorted alphabetically** and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be `America`, `Asia`, and `Europe`, respectively.

The test cases are generated so that the student number from America is not less than either Asia or Europe.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Student table:
+--------+-----------+
| name   | continent |
+--------+-----------+
| Jane   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jack   | America   |
+--------+-----------+
Output:
+---------+------+--------+
| America | Asia | Europe |
+---------+------+--------+
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    | null | null   |
+---------+------+--------+
```

# SQL Problem: Pivoting Student Continents

Let me solve this problem step by step, sharing my thought process as I work through it.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Identify what we're trying to accomplish and the expected output format.

**My thought process:**  
This is a pivoting problem - we need to transform rows (student records by continent) into columns (continents with student names). The key challenges are:  

- Converting continent values into column headers
- Sorting names alphabetically under each continent
- Handling multiple students per continent (requiring multiple rows in the result)
- Filling with NULL when a continent has fewer students than others

We're told America has at least as many students as Asia or Europe, which affects how many rows we'll need in the output.

### 2. Analyzing the Core Transformation

**Procedural step:** Determine the SQL techniques needed for pivoting.

**My thought process:**  
SQL doesn't have a straightforward PIVOT function in all dialects. In MySQL, we typically use conditional aggregation with MAX/MIN and GROUP BY. The challenge is finding what to group by - we need something that creates "row positions" within each continent.  

We could use:

1. ROW_NUMBER() to assign positions within each continent
2. GROUP BY those position numbers to align students across continents
3. Use conditional logic (IF/CASE) to place names in the right columns

This approach would work regardless of which continent has the most students.

### 3. Creating a Position Identifier

**Procedural step:** Generate position numbers for each student within their continent.

```SQL
-- First, let's assign row numbers within each continent
WITH ranked_students AS (
    SELECT
        name,
        continent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS position
    FROM Student
)
```

**My thought process:**  
The window function ROW_NUMBER() gives each student a sequential number within their continent group, ordering alphabetically by name. This creates a "position" that we can use to align students across continents.  

For example, the first alphabetical student from each continent will all have position=1, the second will have position=2, and so on.

### 4. Transforming Rows to Columns

**Procedural step:** Use conditional aggregation to pivot the data.

```SQL
-- Now use conditional aggregation to pivot the data
SELECT
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN name END) AS 'America',
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Asia' THEN name END) AS 'Asia',
    MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Europe' THEN name END) AS 'Europe'
FROM ranked_students
GROUP BY position
```

**My thought process:**  
For each position, we create three columns, one for each continent. The CASE expressions filter students by continent, and MAX() aggregates these values within each position group.  

Only one name will match each continent+position combination, so MAX() effectively selects that name. For positions where a continent has no student, the CASE expression returns NULL.

### 5. Using MySQL Specific Syntax

**Procedural step:** Optimize the query using MySQL's IF function.

```SQL
-- Using MySQL's IF function for cleaner syntax
SELECT
    MAX(IF(continent = 'America', name, NULL)) AS 'America',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Asia', name, NULL)) AS 'Asia',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Europe', name, NULL)) AS 'Europe'
FROM ranked_students
GROUP BY position
```

**My thought process:**  
MySQL's IF function is more concise than CASE for simple conditions. The third parameter (NULL) is technically redundant since the MAX of no values is NULL anyway, but it makes the intent clearer.  

### 6. Combining into the Final Solution

**Procedural step:** Put it all together into a complete query.

```SQL
WITH ranked_students AS (
    SELECT
        name,
        continent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS position
    FROM Student
)
SELECT
    MAX(IF(continent = 'America', name, NULL)) AS 'America',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Asia', name, NULL)) AS 'Asia',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Europe', name, NULL)) AS 'Europe'
FROM ranked_students
GROUP BY position
```

**My thought process:**  
This solution handles all the requirements:  

- It correctly pivots continents into columns
- Names are sorted alphabetically within each continent
- Multiple students per continent are displayed in separate rows
- NULL values appear when a continent has fewer students than others

### 7. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Validate the solution against the example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution:  

1. Initial data:
    - America: Jack, Jane (alphabetically ordered)
    - Asia: Xi
    - Europe: Pascal
2. After applying ROW_NUMBER():
    - (Jack, America, 1)
    - (Jane, America, 2)
    - (Xi, Asia, 1)
    - (Pascal, Europe, 1)
3. After pivoting and grouping by position:
    - Position 1: America = Jack, Asia = Xi, Europe = Pascal
    - Position 2: America = Jane, Asia = NULL, Europe = NULL

This matches the expected output.

### 8. Considering the Follow-up Question

**Procedural step:** Address the follow-up about unknown continent sizes.

**My thought process:**  
Our solution actually already handles this! By using ROW_NUMBER() and GROUP BY position, we're creating a row for each position up to the maximum number of students in any continent.  

If America doesn't have the most students, our query would still work correctly - we'd get the right number of rows based on whichever continent has the most students.

### 9. Alternative Approaches

**Procedural step:** Consider other solutions to the problem.

**My thought process:**  
We could also solve this using:  

1. **Dynamic SQL** - Generate the query based on the continents in the data:
    
    ```SQL
    -- Pseudocode for dynamic SQL approach
    SET @sql = 'SELECT ';
    
    -- Get list of continents
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
        'MAX(CASE WHEN continent = ''', continent, ''' THEN name END) AS ''', continent, ''''
    ) INTO @columns FROM Student;
    
    SET @sql = CONCAT(@sql, @columns, ' FROM (SELECT name, continent, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS position FROM Student) t GROUP BY position');
    
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
    ```
    
    This would work for any continents, not just the three specified. But it's more complex and not supported in all SQL dialects.
    
2. **Using temporary tables or variables**:
    
    ```SQL
    -- Pseudocode for temporary table approach
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ranked_students AS
    SELECT
        name,
        continent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS position
    FROM Student;
    
    SELECT
        MAX(IF(continent = 'America', name, NULL)) AS 'America',
        MAX(IF(continent = 'Asia', name, NULL)) AS 'Asia',
        MAX(IF(continent = 'Europe', name, NULL)) AS 'Europe'
    FROM ranked_students
    GROUP BY position;
    
    DROP TEMPORARY TABLE ranked_students;
    ```
    
    This separates the logic more clearly but requires administrative privileges and isn't always practical.
    

## Final Solution

After considering all approaches, the most elegant solution is:

```SQL
WITH ranked_students AS (
    SELECT
        name,
        continent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS position
    FROM Student
)
SELECT
    MAX(IF(continent = 'America', name, NULL)) AS 'America',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Asia', name, NULL)) AS 'Asia',
    MAX(IF(continent = 'Europe', name, NULL)) AS 'Europe'
FROM ranked_students
GROUP BY position;
```

This solution:

1. Assigns positions to students within their continent, sorted alphabetically by name
2. Uses conditional aggregation to pivot the data into columns
3. Groups by position to align students across continents
4. Automatically handles the case where continents have different numbers of students
5. Works regardless of which continent has the most students

The approach can also be extended to handle dynamic continent values if necessary, making it a robust solution to the pivoting problem.
