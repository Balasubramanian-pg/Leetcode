**Description**

Table: `Listens`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| song_id     | int     |
| day         | date    |
+-------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that the user user_id listened to the song song_id on the day day.
```

Table: `Friendship`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id < user2_id.
```

Write a solution to report the similar friends of Leetcodify users. A user `x` and user `y` are similar friends if:

- Users `x` and `y` are friends, and
- Users `x` and `y` listened to the same three or more different songs **on the same day**.

Return the result table in **any order**. Note that you must return the similar pairs of friends the same way they were represented in the input (i.e., always `user1_id < user2_id`).

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 are friends, and they listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day. They are similar friends.
Users 1 and 3 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day, but they are not friends.
Users 2 and 4 are friends, but they did not listen to the same three different songs.
Users 2 and 5 are friends and listened to songs 10, 11, and 12, but they did not listen to them on the same day.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find "similar friends" based on these criteria:

1. The users must be friends (already connected in the Friendship table)
2. They must have listened to 3 or more of the same songs on the same day
3. The output should maintain the ordering where user1_id < user2_id

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Find distinct user-song-day combinations

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        song_id,
        day
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, song_id, day
)
```

Explanation: First, we create a CTE to get distinct combinations of user_id, song_id, and day to handle potential duplicates in the input data.

## Step 2: Find pairs of users who listened to the same songs on the same day

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        song_id,
        day
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, song_id, day
),
common_listens AS (
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END AS user1_id,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END AS user2_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id < l2.user_id
    GROUP BY
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END,
        l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
```

Explanation: We join the user_listens table with itself to find pairs of users who listened to the same songs on the same day. We use CASE statements to ensure user1_id < user2_id as specified in the problem. We group by the user pair and day, then count distinct songs they have in common, filtering for 3 or more.

## Step 3: Join with Friendship table to only include friends

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        song_id,
        day
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, song_id, day
),
common_listens AS (
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END AS user1_id,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END AS user2_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id < l2.user_id
    GROUP BY
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END,
        l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    cl.user1_id,
    cl.user2_id
FROM common_listens cl
JOIN Friendship f ON
    cl.user1_id = f.user1_id AND
    cl.user2_id = f.user2_id
```

Explanation: We join the common_listens CTE with the Friendship table to ensure we only include pairs where the users are already friends. The DISTINCT keyword ensures we don't have duplicate pairs in the final result.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        song_id,
        day
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, song_id, day
),
common_listens AS (
    SELECT
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END AS user1_id,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END AS user2_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id <> l2.user_id
    GROUP BY
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END,
        CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END,
        l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    cl.user1_id,
    cl.user2_id
FROM common_listens cl
JOIN Friendship f ON
    cl.user1_id = f.user1_id AND
    cl.user2_id = f.user2_id
```

This solution:

1. Creates a deduplicated view of user listening patterns
2. Finds user pairs who listened to 3+ same songs on the same day
3. Ensures the ordering where user1_id < user2_id
4. Filters to only include pairs where the users are friends
5. Removes any potential duplicate pairs in the final result

The query correctly implements all requirements and finds similar friends based on the specified criteria.
