**Description**

Table: `Listens`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| song_id     | int     |
| day         | date    |
+-------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table indicates that the user user_id listened to the song song_id on the day day.
```

Table: `Friendship`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id < user2_id.
```

Recommend friends to Leetcodify users. We recommend user `x` to user `y` if:

- Users `x` and `y` are not friends, and
- Users `x` and `y` listened to the same three or more different songs **on the same day**.

Note that friend recommendations are **unidirectional**, meaning if user `x` and user `y` should be recommended to each other, the result table should have both user `x` recommended to user `y` and user `y` recommended to user `x`. Also, note that the result table should not contain duplicates (i.e., user `y` should not be recommended to user `x` multiple times.).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day, but they are already friends.
Users 1 and 3 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day. Since they are not friends, we recommend them to each other.
Users 1 and 4 did not listen to the same three songs.
Users 1 and 5 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12, but on different days.

Similarly, we can see that users 2 and 3 listened to songs 10, 11, and 12 on the same day and are not friends, so we recommend them to each other.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

We need to recommend friends to users based on these criteria:

1. Users are not already friends
2. Users listened to the same 3 or more different songs on the same day

The recommendations are unidirectional, so if user X should be recommended to user Y, we need separate rows for both directions.

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Find pairs of users who listened to the same songs on the same day

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        day,
        song_id
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, day, song_id
)
```

Explanation: First, I'm creating a CTE with distinct user-day-song combinations to eliminate potential duplicates in the input data.

## Step 2: Find pairs of users who listened to at least 3 same songs on the same day

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        day,
        song_id
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, day, song_id
),
potential_recommendations AS (
    SELECT
        l1.user_id AS user_id,
        l2.user_id AS recommended_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id <> l2.user_id
    GROUP BY l1.user_id, l2.user_id, l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
```

Explanation: Now I join the user_listens table with itself to find pairs of different users who listened to the same songs on the same day. I group by the user pairs and day, then count distinct songs they have in common, filtering for 3 or more.

## Step 3: Exclude existing friendships

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        day,
        song_id
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, day, song_id
),
friendship_both_ways AS (
    SELECT user1_id, user2_id FROM Friendship
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id, user1_id FROM Friendship
),
potential_recommendations AS (
    SELECT
        l1.user_id AS user_id,
        l2.user_id AS recommended_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id <> l2.user_id
    GROUP BY l1.user_id, l2.user_id, l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
SELECT
    pr.user_id,
    pr.recommended_id
FROM potential_recommendations pr
LEFT JOIN friendship_both_ways f ON
    pr.user_id = f.user1_id AND
    pr.recommended_id = f.user2_id
WHERE f.user1_id IS NULL
```

Explanation: I create a CTE to represent friendships in both directions, since the problem states that user1_id < user2_id in the Friendship table. Then I exclude pairs where a friendship already exists.

## Step 4: Remove duplicates in final result

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        day,
        song_id
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, day, song_id
),
friendship_both_ways AS (
    SELECT user1_id, user2_id FROM Friendship
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id, user1_id FROM Friendship
),
potential_recommendations AS (
    SELECT
        l1.user_id AS user_id,
        l2.user_id AS recommended_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id <> l2.user_id
    GROUP BY l1.user_id, l2.user_id, l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    pr.user_id,
    pr.recommended_id
FROM potential_recommendations pr
LEFT JOIN friendship_both_ways f ON
    pr.user_id = f.user1_id AND
    pr.recommended_id = f.user2_id
WHERE f.user1_id IS NULL
```

Explanation: I add DISTINCT to the final SELECT to remove any potential duplicate recommendations for the same user pair.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH user_listens AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        day,
        song_id
    FROM Listens
    GROUP BY user_id, day, song_id
),
friendship_both_ways AS (
    SELECT user1_id AS user1_id, user2_id AS user2_id FROM Friendship
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id AS user1_id, user1_id AS user2_id FROM Friendship
),
potential_recommendations AS (
    SELECT
        l1.user_id AS user_id,
        l2.user_id AS recommended_id,
        l1.day,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) AS common_songs
    FROM user_listens l1
    JOIN user_listens l2 ON
        l1.day = l2.day AND
        l1.song_id = l2.song_id AND
        l1.user_id <> l2.user_id
    GROUP BY l1.user_id, l2.user_id, l1.day
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l1.song_id) >= 3
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    pr.user_id,
    pr.recommended_id
FROM potential_recommendations pr
LEFT JOIN friendship_both_ways f ON
    pr.user_id = f.user1_id AND
    pr.recommended_id = f.user2_id
WHERE f.user1_id IS NULL
```

This solution:

1. Creates a deduplicated view of user listening patterns
2. Represents friendships in both directions for easier filtering
3. Finds user pairs who listened to 3+ same songs on the same day
4. Excludes existing friendships
5. Removes any duplicate recommendations

The query correctly implements all requirements and produces recommendations based on the specified criteria.
