**Description**

Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

The **install date** of a player is the first login day of that player.

We define **day one retention** of some date `x` to be the number of players whose **install date** is `x` and they logged back in on the day right after `x`, divided by the number of players whose install date is `x`, rounded to `2` decimal places.

Write a solution to report for each install date, the number of players that installed the game on that day, and the **day one retention**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Explanation:
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00
```

**Solutions**

# SQL Problem: Day One Retention Analysis

Let me solve this problem step by step, sharing my thought process throughout.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Define the key metrics and requirements.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to calculate:  

1. Install date: The first login date for each player
2. Number of installs per day: Count of players whose first login was on that day
3. Day one retention: Proportion of players who logged in again exactly one day after their install date

The calculation for day one retention is:

- Numerator: Number of players who logged in on the day immediately after their install date
- Denominator: Total number of players who installed on that date
- Result should be rounded to 2 decimal places

We need to return a table with install_dt, installs, and Day1_retention columns.

### 2. Identifying the First Login (Install Date) Per Player

**Procedural step:** Determine how to find each player's install date.

**My thought process:**  
To find the install date for each player, we need the minimum event_date for each player_id. There are a few ways to do this:  

1. Using a window function:

```SQL
SELECT
    player_id,
    event_date,
    MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
FROM Activity
```

1. Using a subquery:

```SQL
SELECT
    a.*,
    (SELECT MIN(event_date) FROM Activity WHERE player_id = a.player_id) AS install_dt
FROM Activity a
```

1. Using a self-join:

```SQL
SELECT
    a.*,
    first_login.event_date AS install_dt
FROM Activity a
JOIN (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS event_date
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
) first_login ON a.player_id = first_login.player_id
```

I prefer the window function approach because it's concise and efficient, avoiding multiple passes through the data.

### 3. Calculating the Number of Installs Per Day

**Procedural step:** Count distinct players per install date.

**My thought process:**  
Once we have the install date for each player, we need to count how many players installed the game on each day. We can do this by:  

1. Grouping by install_dt
2. Counting distinct player_ids in each group

```SQL
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs
FROM (
    [query from previous step]
) t
GROUP BY install_dt
```

The DISTINCT is important here to avoid counting a player multiple times if they have multiple activity records.

### 4. Calculating Day One Retention

**Procedural step:** Calculate the proportion of players who returned the day after installation.

**My thought process:**  
For day one retention, we need to:  

1. Identify players who logged in exactly one day after their install date
2. Count those players per install date
3. Divide by the total number of players who installed on that date
4. Round to 2 decimal places

To determine if a player logged in the day after installation, we can check if there's an event_date that's exactly one day after the install_dt for that player.

We can use DATEDIFF or date arithmetic to check if the difference between event_date and install_dt is exactly 1 day.

```SQL
-- For each install date and player combination
-- Check if there's an event_date that's install_dt + 1
-- Sum these (1 for yes, 0 for no) and divide by total installs
```

### 5. Putting It All Together

**Procedural step:** Combine the previous steps into a complete solution.

**My thought process:**  
Let's use a CTE to first identify all player logins with their install date, then aggregate to get our metrics:  

```SQL
WITH PlayerInstalls AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
        COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS Day1_retention
FROM PlayerInstalls
GROUP BY install_dt;
```

I'm using the CASE expression to count players who have a login date exactly 1 day after their install date. However, there's an issue with this approach: it will count all records with event_date - install_dt = 1, even those from the same player. Since we're just counting whether a player returned, not how many times, we need to adjust this.

### 6. Refining the Solution

**Procedural step:** Fix potential overcounting in the day one retention calculation.

**My thought process:**  
To correctly count returning players, we have two options:  

1. Use EXISTS to check if a player has any record one day after install:

```SQL
WITH InstallDates AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS install_dt
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT
    i.install_dt,
    COUNT(i.player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        SUM(
            CASE WHEN EXISTS (
                SELECT 1 FROM Activity a
                WHERE a.player_id = i.player_id
                AND a.event_date = DATE_ADD(i.install_dt, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
            ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
        ) / COUNT(i.player_id),
        2
    ) AS Day1_retention
FROM InstallDates i
GROUP BY i.install_dt;
```

1. Count distinct players who have return dates and divide by total distinct players:

```SQL
WITH PlayerInstalls AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1 THEN player_id END) /
        COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS Day1_retention
FROM PlayerInstalls
GROUP BY install_dt;
```

However, there's a simpler approach that leverages SQL's boolean expressions:

```SQL
WITH PlayerInstalls AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        SUM(DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1) /
        COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS Day1_retention
FROM PlayerInstalls
GROUP BY install_dt;
```

In this version, the expression `DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1` evaluates to 1 when true and 0 when false, so SUM counts the rows where this condition is true.

### 7. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Validate the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution:  

First, we identify install dates:

- Player 1: 2016-03-01
- Player 2: 2017-06-25
- Player 3: 2016-03-01

Then, we expand each row with the install date:

- (1, 2016-03-01, 2016-03-01)
- (1, 2016-03-02, 2016-03-01)
- (2, 2017-06-25, 2017-06-25)
- (3, 2016-03-01, 2016-03-01)
- (3, 2016-07-03, 2016-03-01)

Now, we group by install_dt and calculate metrics:

For 2016-03-01:

- Installs: 2 players (1 and 3)
- Players who returned next day: 1 player (only player 1 has an event on 2016-03-02)
- Day1_retention: 1/2 = 0.50

For 2017-06-25:

- Installs: 1 player (2)
- Players who returned next day: 0 players (no event on 2017-06-26)
- Day1_retention: 0/1 = 0.00

This matches the expected output.

### 8. Finalizing the Solution

**Procedural step:** Choose the most efficient approach.

**My thought process:**  
Among the approaches discussed, the window function with boolean expression in SUM is the most elegant and efficient. It minimizes data passes and clearly expresses the calculation.  

## Final Solution

After careful consideration, here's the optimal solution:

```SQL
WITH PlayerInstalls AS (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        MIN(event_date) OVER (PARTITION BY player_id) AS install_dt
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT
    install_dt,
    COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) AS installs,
    ROUND(
        SUM(DATEDIFF(event_date, install_dt) = 1) /
        COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),
        2
    ) AS Day1_retention
FROM PlayerInstalls
GROUP BY install_dt;
```

This solution:

1. Efficiently identifies each player's install date using a window function
2. Counts distinct players for the installs metric
3. Uses a boolean expression to count players who returned the next day
4. Calculates the retention ratio and rounds to 2 decimal places
5. Groups results by install date as required

The query performs a single pass over the data (within the CTE) and clearly expresses the retention calculation, making it both efficient and maintainable.
