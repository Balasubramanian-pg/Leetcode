**Description**

Table: `Tweets`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| tweet_id    | int     |
| tweet_date  | date    |
| tweet       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, tweet_id, tweet_date and tweet.
It is guaranteed that all tweet_date are valid dates in February 2024.

```

Write a solution to find the **top** `3` trending **hashtags** in **February** `2024`. Every tweet may contain **several hashtags**.

Return _the result table ordered by count of hashtag, hashtag in_ **descending** _order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Tweets table:

```Plain
+---------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| user_id | tweet_id | tweet                                                      | tweet_date |
+---------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
| 135     | 13       | Enjoying a great start to the day. \#HappyDay \#MorningVibes | 2024-02-01 |
| 136     | 14       | Another \#HappyDay with good vibes! \#FeelGood               | 2024-02-03 |
| 137     | 15       | Productivity peaks! \#WorkLife \#ProductiveDay               | 2024-02-04 |
| 138     | 16       | Exploring new tech frontiers. \#TechLife \#Innovation        | 2024-02-04 |
| 139     | 17       | Gratitude for today's moments. \#HappyDay \#Thankful         | 2024-02-05 |
| 140     | 18       | Innovation drives us. \#TechLife \#FutureTech                | 2024-02-07 |
| 141     | 19       | Connecting with nature's serenity. \#Nature \#Peaceful       | 2024-02-09 |
+---------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------+-------+
| hashtag   | count |
+-----------+-------+
| \#HappyDay | 3     |
| \#TechLife | 2     |
| \#WorkLife | 1     |
+-----------+-------+

```

**Explanation:**

- **\#HappyDay:** Appeared in tweet IDs 13, 14, and 17, with a total count of 3 mentions.
- **\#TechLife:** Appeared in tweet IDs 16 and 18, with a total count of 2 mentions.
- **\#WorkLife:** Appeared in tweet ID 15, with a total count of 1 mention.

**Note:** Output table is sorted in descending order by count and hashtag respectively.

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understand the problem  
This problem requires us to extract hashtags from tweets, count their occurrences, and return the top 3 hashtags ordered by count (descending) and then by the hashtag itself (descending).  

Step 2: Extract hashtags from tweets

```SQL
SELECT tweet_id, tweet
FROM Tweets
WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
```

Explanation: First, we need to get all tweets from February 2024. We're using a simple SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter tweets by date.

Step 3: Now we need to extract the hashtags from each tweet

```SQL
WITH tweet_words AS (
  SELECT tweet_id,
         regexp_substr(tweet, '#[A-Za-z0-9_]+') AS hashtag
  FROM Tweets
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
)
```

Explanation: This approach won't work properly because each tweet may contain multiple hashtags, and we need to extract all of them. Let's use a different approach.

Step 4: Split the tweets and extract all hashtags

```SQL
WITH hashtag_extraction AS (
  SELECT tweet_id,
         unnest(regexp_matches(tweet, '#[A-Za-z0-9_]+', 'g')) AS hashtag
  FROM Tweets
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
)
```

Explanation: This query uses the `unnest` and `regexp_matches` functions to extract all hashtags from each tweet. The 'g' flag ensures we get all matches, not just the first one.

Step 5: Count the occurrences of each hashtag

```SQL
WITH hashtag_extraction AS (
  SELECT tweet_id,
         unnest(regexp_matches(tweet, '#[A-Za-z0-9_]+', 'g')) AS hashtag
  FROM Tweets
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
),
hashtag_counts AS (
  SELECT hashtag, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM hashtag_extraction
  GROUP BY hashtag
)
```

Explanation: After extracting all hashtags, we count how many times each hashtag appears using the GROUP BY clause.

Step 6: Get the top 3 hashtags ordered by count and hashtag

```SQL
WITH hashtag_extraction AS (
  SELECT tweet_id,
         unnest(regexp_matches(tweet, '#[A-Za-z0-9_]+', 'g')) AS hashtag
  FROM Tweets
  WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
),
hashtag_counts AS (
  SELECT hashtag, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM hashtag_extraction
  GROUP BY hashtag
)
SELECT hashtag, count
FROM hashtag_counts
ORDER BY count DESC, hashtag DESC
LIMIT 3
```

Explanation: Finally, we order the results by count in descending order, then by hashtag in descending order, and limit the results to the top 3.

Step 7: Refining for specific database systems  
Since different database systems have different functions for extracting patterns, let's adjust our solution for a more standard approach using common SQL functions:  

Let me explain this final solution step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
We need to find the top 3 trending hashtags in February 2024 from the Tweets table. Each tweet may contain multiple hashtags, so we need to extract them all, count them, and then display the top 3 by count (descending) and then by hashtag text (also descending).  

Step 2: Extract Words from Tweets

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE extracted_hashtags AS (
    SELECT
        tweet_id,
        SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(tweet, ' ', numbers.n), ' ', -1) AS word,
        tweet
    FROM
        Tweets
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL
        SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL
        SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10
    ) AS numbers
    WHERE
        tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
        AND numbers.n <= 1 + LENGTH(tweet) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet, ' ', ''))
)
```

Explanation: This is the most complex part of the solution. We create a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) that:

- Creates a numbers table with values 1 through 10 (assuming no tweet has more than 10 words)
- For each tweet, it splits the text into individual words using `SUBSTRING_INDEX`
- We limit the words to the actual number of words in the tweet using the condition that compares with the number of spaces

Step 3: Filter Only Hashtags

```SQL
hashtags AS (
    SELECT word AS hashtag
    FROM extracted_hashtags
    WHERE word LIKE '#%'
)
```

Explanation: Now we filter to keep only the words that start with '#', which are our hashtags.

Step 4: Count the Occurrences of Each Hashtag

```SQL
hashtag_counts AS (
    SELECT
        hashtag,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM hashtags
    GROUP BY hashtag
)
```

Explanation: We group by the hashtag and count how many times each one appears.

Step 5: Get the Top 3 Trending Hashtags

```SQL
SELECT
    hashtag,
    count
FROM hashtag_counts
ORDER BY count DESC, hashtag DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

Explanation: Finally, we order the results by count in descending order (highest first), then by hashtag text also in descending order, and limit the results to just the top 3.

The solution works by:

1. Breaking each tweet into individual words
2. Filtering out only hashtags (words starting with #)
3. Counting how many times each hashtag appears
4. Sorting by count and hashtag text
5. Taking only the top 3

This approach handles the challenge of extracting multiple hashtags from each tweet and correctly counts their occurrences across all tweets from February 2024.

```SQL
-- Step 1: Create a recursive CTE to extract hashtags from each tweet
WITH RECURSIVE extracted_hashtags AS (
    SELECT 
        tweet_id,
        SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(tweet, ' ', numbers.n), ' ', -1) AS word,
        tweet
    FROM 
        Tweets
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL
        SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5 UNION ALL SELECT 6 UNION ALL 
        SELECT 7 UNION ALL SELECT 8 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 10
    ) AS numbers
    WHERE 
        tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'
        AND numbers.n <= 1 + LENGTH(tweet) - LENGTH(REPLACE(tweet, ' ', ''))
),

-- Step 2: Filter only hashtags
hashtags AS (
    SELECT word AS hashtag
    FROM extracted_hashtags
    WHERE word LIKE '#%'
),

-- Step 3: Count occurrences of each hashtag
hashtag_counts AS (
    SELECT
        hashtag,
        COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM hashtags
    GROUP BY hashtag
)

-- Step 4: Get the top 3 trending hashtags
SELECT
    hashtag,
    count
FROM hashtag_counts
ORDER BY count DESC, hashtag DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
