**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store       | varchar |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(product_id, store) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of product_id in store.
There will be at most 30 different stores in the table.
price is the price of the product at this store.
```

**Important note:** This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.

Implement the procedure `PivotProducts` to reorganize the `Products` table so that each row has the id of one product and its price in each store. The price should be `null` if the product is not sold in a store. The columns of the table should contain each store and they should be sorted in **lexicographical order**.

The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | store    | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 1          | Shop     | 110   |
| 1          | LC_Store | 100   |
| 2          | Nozama   | 200   |
| 2          | Souq     | 190   |
| 3          | Shop     | 1000  |
| 3          | Souq     | 1900  |
+------------+----------+-------+
Output:
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
| product_id | LC_Store | Nozama | Shop | Souq |
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
| 1          | 100      | null   | 110  | null |
| 2          | null     | 200    | null | 190  |
| 3          | null     | null   | 1000 | 1900 |
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
Explanation:
We have 4 stores: Shop, LC_Store, Nozama, and Souq. We first order them lexicographically to be: LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, and Souq.
Now, for product 1, the price in LC_Store is 100 and in Shop is 110. For the other two stores, the product is not sold so we set the price as null.
Similarly, product 2 has a price of 200 in Nozama and 190 in Souq. It is not sold in the other two stores.
For product 3, the price is 1000 in Shop and 1900 in Souq. It is not sold in the other two stores.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This is a pivot table problem where we need to:

1. Transform rows into columns where each store becomes a column
2. Each product gets a single row with its price in each store
3. If a product is not sold in a store, the price should be null
4. Store columns should be sorted in lexicographical order

This is a more advanced SQL problem that requires dynamic SQL since we need to create columns based on the data in the table.

## Step 1: Identify the approach

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE PivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- This is where our logic will go
END
```

Explanation: We start by creating the procedure as required. For a pivot operation in SQL, we'll typically use conditional aggregation or a dynamic SQL approach.

## Step 2: Using conditional aggregation with MAX and CASE

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE PivotProducts()
BEGIN
    SELECT product_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'LC_Store' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS LC_Store,
           MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'Nozama' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS Nozama,
           MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'Shop' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS Shop,
           MAX(CASE WHEN store = 'Souq' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS Souq
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY product_id;
END
```

Explanation: This approach works if we know all the store names in advance. We use MAX with CASE expressions to pivot the data. The MAX function is used because each product-store combination is unique, so we're really just picking the single non-NULL value.

## Step 3: Using dynamic SQL for a more flexible solution

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE PivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- Create a variable to hold our dynamic SQL statement
    SET @sql = NULL;

    -- Build the column list dynamically from the stores in the table
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
           CONCAT('MAX(CASE WHEN store = ''', store, ''' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS `', store, '`')
           ORDER BY store)
    INTO @sql
    FROM Products;

    -- Complete the SQL statement
    SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT product_id, ', @sql, ' FROM Products GROUP BY product_id');

    -- Prepare and execute the statement
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END
```

Explanation: This dynamic SQL approach:

1. Builds a list of columns dynamically based on the stores in the table
2. Orders the stores lexicographically as required
3. Constructs a complete SQL statement with these dynamic columns
4. Prepares and executes this statement

## Final Solution:

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE PivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- Create a variable to hold our dynamic SQL statement
    SET @sql = NULL;

    -- Build the column list dynamically from the stores in the table
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
           CONCAT('MAX(CASE WHEN store = ''', store, ''' THEN price ELSE NULL END) AS `', store, '`')
           ORDER BY store)
    INTO @sql
    FROM Products;

    -- Complete the SQL statement
    SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT product_id, ', @sql, ' FROM Products GROUP BY product_id');

    -- Prepare and execute the statement
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Creates a procedure called PivotProducts as required
2. Uses dynamic SQL to generate a pivot query that can handle any number of stores
3. Orders the store columns lexicographically
4. Groups by product_id to ensure each product has a single row
5. Uses MAX with CASE to handle the pivot operation
6. Returns NULL for products not sold in particular stores

The dynamic SQL approach is particularly powerful because it automatically adapts to any stores in the table, not just the ones in the example. This makes the solution robust if new stores are added to the database in the future.
