**Description**

Table: `Terms`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| power       | int  |
| factor      | int  |
+-------------+------+
power is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one term of the equation.
power is an integer in the range [0, 100].
factor is an integer in the range [-100, 100] and cannot be zero.
```

You have a very powerful program that can solve any  
equation of one variable in the world. The equation passed to the  
program must be formatted as follows:  

- The left-hand side (LHS) should contain all the terms.
- The right-hand side (RHS) should be zero.
- Each term of the LHS should follow the format `"<sign><fact>X^<pow>"` where:
    - `<sign>` is either `"+"` or `"-"`.
    - `<fact>` is the **absolute value** of the `factor`.
    - `<pow>` is the value of the `power`.
- If the power is `1`, do not add `"^<pow>"`.
    - For example, if `power = 1` and `factor = 3`, the term will be `"+3X"`.
- If the power is `0`, add neither `"X"` nor `"^<pow>"`.
    - For example, if `power = 0` and `factor = -3`, the term will be `"-3"`.
- The powers in the LHS should be sorted in **descending order**.

Write a solution to build the equation.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Terms table:
+-------+--------+
| power | factor |
+-------+--------+
| 2     | 1      |
| 1     | -4     |
| 0     | 2      |
+-------+--------+
Output:
+--------------+
| equation     |
+--------------+
| +1X^2-4X+2=0 |
+--------------+
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
Terms table:
+-------+--------+
| power | factor |
+-------+--------+
| 4     | -4     |
| 2     | 1      |
| 1     | -1     |
+-------+--------+
Output:
+-----------------+
| equation        |
+-----------------+
| -4X^4+1X^2-1X=0 |
+-----------------+
```

**Solutions**

### Solution 1

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part clearly.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Create an equation string from terms in a table
2. Each term has a power and a factor
3. Format each term as "+factorX^power" or "-factorX^power" (using absolute value of factor)
4. Special cases: if power=1, omit "^power"; if power=0, omit "X^power"
5. Terms must be in descending order of power
6. The equation ends with "=0"

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Format terms based on their power and factor

```SQL
SELECT
    power,
    CASE
        WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor)
        WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor))
    END AS term_sign_and_factor
FROM Terms
ORDER BY power DESC;
```

Explanation: We start by creating the sign and factor part of each term. If the factor is positive, we add a '+' before it; if negative, we add a '-' and use the absolute value of the factor.

## Step 2: Add the 'X' and power notation to each term

```SQL
SELECT
    power,
    CASE
        WHEN power = 0 THEN CASE
                               WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor)
                               WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor))
                           END
        WHEN power = 1 THEN CASE
                               WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X')
                               WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X')
                           END
        ELSE CASE
                WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X^', power)
                WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X^', power)
             END
    END AS formatted_term
FROM Terms
ORDER BY power DESC;
```

Explanation: Now we add the variable 'X' and power notation based on the special cases:

- For power=0: just use the sign and factor (no X or power)
- For power=1: add X but no power
- For all other powers: include X^power

## Step 3: Concatenate all terms into the equation

```SQL
SELECT CONCAT(
        GROUP_CONCAT(
            CASE
                WHEN power = 0 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor)
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor))
                                   END
                WHEN power = 1 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X')
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X')
                                   END
                ELSE CASE
                        WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X^', power)
                        WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X^', power)
                     END
            END
            ORDER BY power DESC SEPARATOR ''
        ), '=0'
    ) AS equation
FROM Terms;
```

Explanation: We use GROUP_CONCAT to combine all the formatted terms into a single string, ordered by power in descending order. Then we append "=0" to complete the equation.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT CONCAT(
        GROUP_CONCAT(
            CASE
                WHEN power = 0 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor)
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor))
                                   END
                WHEN power = 1 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X')
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X')
                                   END
                ELSE CASE
                        WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X^', power)
                        WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X^', power)
                     END
            END
            ORDER BY power DESC SEPARATOR ''
        ), '=0'
    ) AS equation
FROM Terms;
```

This query:

1. Creates formatted terms for each row in the Terms table
2. Combines all terms in descending order of power
3. Adds "=0" to the end to complete the equation
4. Returns the result as a single string

For the follow-up question: If power is not a primary key but each power should be unique in the answer, we would need to add a GROUP BY clause to handle potential duplicate powers. We would select the term with the largest factor (or based on some other criteria) for each power:

```SQL
WITH UniqueTerms AS (
    SELECT
        power,
        -- Select only one factor per power (you could use MAX, MIN, SUM, etc. depending on requirements)
        MAX(factor) AS factor
    FROM Terms
    GROUP BY power
)

SELECT CONCAT(
        GROUP_CONCAT(
            CASE
                WHEN power = 0 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor)
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor))
                                   END
                WHEN power = 1 THEN CASE
                                      WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X')
                                      WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X')
                                   END
                ELSE CASE
                        WHEN factor > 0 THEN CONCAT('+', factor, 'X^', power)
                        WHEN factor < 0 THEN CONCAT('-', ABS(factor), 'X^', power)
                     END
            END
            ORDER BY power DESC SEPARATOR ''
        ), '=0'
    ) AS equation
FROM UniqueTerms;
```
