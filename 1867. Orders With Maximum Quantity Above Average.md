**Description**

Table: `OrdersDetails`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| order_id    | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(order_id, product_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
A single order is represented as multiple rows, one row for each product in the order.
Each row of this table contains the quantity ordered of the product product_id in the order order_id.
```

You are running an e-commerce site that is looking for **imbalanced orders**. An **imbalanced order** is one whose **maximum** quantity is **strictly greater** than the **average** quantity of **every order (including itself)**.

The **average** quantity of an order is calculated as `(total quantity of all products in the order) / (number of different products in the order)`. The **maximum** quantity of an order is the highest `quantity` of any single product in the order.

Write a solution to find the `order_id` of all **imbalanced orders**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
OrdersDetails table:
+----------+------------+----------+
| order_id | product_id | quantity |
+----------+------------+----------+
| 1        | 1          | 12       |
| 1        | 2          | 10       |
| 1        | 3          | 15       |
| 2        | 1          | 8        |
| 2        | 4          | 4        |
| 2        | 5          | 6        |
| 3        | 3          | 5        |
| 3        | 4          | 18       |
| 4        | 5          | 2        |
| 4        | 6          | 8        |
| 5        | 7          | 9        |
| 5        | 8          | 9        |
| 3        | 9          | 20       |
| 2        | 9          | 4        |
+----------+------------+----------+
Output:
+----------+
| order_id |
+----------+
| 1        |
| 3        |
+----------+
Explanation:
The average quantity of each order is:
- order_id=1: (12+10+15)/3 = 12.3333333
- order_id=2: (8+4+6+4)/4 = 5.5
- order_id=3: (5+18+20)/3 = 14.333333
- order_id=4: (2+8)/2 = 5
- order_id=5: (9+9)/2 = 9

The maximum quantity of each order is:
- order_id=1: max(12, 10, 15) = 15
- order_id=2: max(8, 4, 6, 4) = 8
- order_id=3: max(5, 18, 20) = 20
- order_id=4: max(2, 8) = 8
- order_id=5: max(9, 9) = 9

Orders 1 and 3 are imbalanced because they have a maximum quantity that exceeds the average quantity of every order.

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

An "imbalanced order" is defined as one where the maximum quantity of any product in the order is strictly greater than the average quantity of every order (including itself). We need to:

1. Calculate the average quantity for each order
2. Find the maximum quantity for each order
3. Identify orders where the maximum quantity is greater than the average quantity of ALL orders

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Calculate the average quantity for each order

```SQL
SELECT
    order_id,
    SUM(quantity) / COUNT(*) AS avg_quantity
FROM OrdersDetails
GROUP BY order_id
```

Explanation: For each order, we sum up the quantities of all products and divide by the number of different products (COUNT(*)) to get the average quantity per order.

## Step 2: Calculate the maximum quantity for each order

```SQL
SELECT
    order_id,
    MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
FROM OrdersDetails
GROUP BY order_id
```

Explanation: For each order, we find the maximum quantity of any single product in that order.

## Step 3: Combine the calculations

```SQL
SELECT
    order_id,
    SUM(quantity) / COUNT(*) AS avg_quantity,
    MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
FROM OrdersDetails
GROUP BY order_id
```

Explanation: We combine the average and maximum calculations into a single query for efficiency.

## Step 4: Find the imbalanced orders

```SQL
WITH order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(quantity) / COUNT(*) AS avg_quantity,
        MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
    FROM OrdersDetails
    GROUP BY order_id
)
SELECT o1.order_id
FROM order_stats o1
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM order_stats o2
    WHERE o1.max_quantity <= o2.avg_quantity
)
```

Explanation: We create a CTE (Common Table Expression) for our order statistics. Then we select orders (o1) where there does NOT exist any order (o2) whose average quantity is greater than or equal to o1's maximum quantity.

## Step 5: Simplify the solution using a cross join approach

```SQL
WITH order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(quantity) / COUNT(*) AS avg_quantity,
        MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
    FROM OrdersDetails
    GROUP BY order_id
)
SELECT DISTINCT o1.order_id
FROM order_stats o1
JOIN order_stats o2
WHERE o1.max_quantity > ALL (
    SELECT avg_quantity
    FROM order_stats
)
```

Explanation: This alternative approach uses a subquery with the ALL operator to check if an order's maximum quantity is greater than ALL average quantities.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(quantity) / COUNT(*) AS avg_quantity,
        MAX(quantity) AS max_quantity
    FROM OrdersDetails
    GROUP BY order_id
)
SELECT order_id
FROM order_stats
WHERE max_quantity > (
    SELECT MAX(avg_quantity)
    FROM order_stats
)
```

Explanation: This is a more concise solution. Since we need to find orders where the maximum quantity is greater than the average quantity of EVERY order, we can simply check if the maximum quantity is greater than the maximum of all average quantities. If it's greater than the highest average, it's greater than all averages.

The query:

1. Calculates average and maximum quantities for each order
2. Finds the maximum of all average quantities
3. Returns orders where the maximum quantity exceeds this threshold

This solution correctly identifies imbalanced orders as defined in the problem.
