Table: `Triangle`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.
```

Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output:
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether three given line segments can form a triangle. The solution involves checking the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three line segments to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

### Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that three line segments can form a triangle if they satisfy the triangle inequality conditions:
    - The sum of any two sides must be strictly greater than the third side.
    - Specifically, the conditions to check are:
        - \( x + y > z \)
        - \( x + z > y \)
        - \( y + z > x \)
2. **Algorithm Selection**: We use a SQL `CASE` statement to evaluate these three conditions for each row in the `Triangle` table. If all three conditions are satisfied, the result is 'Yes'; otherwise, it is 'No'.
3. **Optimization**: The solution efficiently checks all necessary conditions in a single pass through the data, leveraging SQL's ability to evaluate multiple conditions in a `CASE` statement.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    x,
    y,
    z,
    CASE
        WHEN (x + y > z) AND (x + z > y) AND (y + z > x) THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

### Explanation

- **SELECT Clause**: The query selects all columns (`x`, `y`, `z`) from the `Triangle` table and adds a computed column `triangle`.
- **CASE Statement**: This evaluates whether the three line segments can form a triangle:
    - The conditions \(x + y > z\), \(x + z > y\), and \(y + z > x\) are checked.
    - If all conditions are true, the result is 'Yes'; otherwise, it is 'No'.
- **Result**: The output includes all original columns plus the `triangle` column indicating whether the segments can form a triangle ('Yes' or 'No').

This approach efficiently checks the triangle inequality conditions for each row and categorizes the result accordingly, providing a clear and concise solution.
