**Description**

Table: `EmployeeShifts`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| start_time       | time    |
| end_time         | time    |
+------------------+---------+
(employee_id, start_time) is the unique key for this table.
This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start and end times on a specific date.
```

Write a solution to count the number of **overlapping shifts** for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if one shift’s `end_time` is **later than** another shift’s `start_time`.

_Return the result table ordered by_ `employee_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`EmployeeShifts` table:

```Plain
+-------------+------------+----------+
| employee_id | start_time | end_time |
+-------------+------------+----------+
| 1           | 08:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 1           | 11:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 1           | 14:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 2           | 09:00:00   | 17:00:00 |
| 2           | 16:00:00   | 20:00:00 |
| 3           | 10:00:00   | 12:00:00 |
| 3           | 13:00:00   | 15:00:00 |
| 3           | 16:00:00   | 18:00:00 |
| 4           | 08:00:00   | 10:00:00 |
| 4           | 09:00:00   | 11:00:00 |
+-------------+------------+----------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+--------------------+
| employee_id | overlapping_shifts |
+-------------+--------------------+
| 1           | 2                  |
| 2           | 1                  |
| 4           | 1                  |
+-------------+--------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Employee 1 has 3 shifts: The first shift overlaps with the second, and the second overlaps with the third, resulting in 2 overlapping shifts.
    - 08:00:00 to 12:00:00
    - 11:00:00 to 15:00:00
    - 14:00:00 to 18:00:00
- Employee 2 has 2 shifts: These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.
    - 09:00:00 to 17:00:00
    - 16:00:00 to 20:00:00
- Employee 3 has 3 shifts: None of these shifts overlap, so Employee 3 is not included in the output.
    - 10:00:00 to 12:00:00
    - 13:00:00 to 15:00:00
    - 16:00:00 to 18:00:00
- Employee 4 has 2 shifts: These shifts overlap with each other, resulting in 1 overlapping shift.
    - 08:00:00 to 10:00:00
    - 09:00:00 to 11:00:00

The output shows the employee_id and the count of  
overlapping shifts for each employee who has at least one overlapping  
shift, ordered by employee_id in ascending order.  

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Self-Join + Group Counting**

We first use a self-join to connect the `EmployeeShifts`  
table to itself. The join condition ensures that we only compare shifts  
belonging to the same employee and check if there is any overlap  
between shifts.  

1. `t1.start_time < t2.start_time`: Ensures that the start time of the first shift is earlier than the start time of the second shift.
2. `t1.end_time > t2.start_time`: Ensures that the end time of the first shift is later than the start time of the second shift.

Next, we group the data by `employee_id` and count the number of overlapping shifts for each employee.

Finally, we filter out employees with overlapping shift counts greater than 0 and sort the results in ascending order by `employee_id`.

  

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Identify **overlapping shifts** for each employee.
2. Two shifts overlap if one shift’s `end_time` is later than another shift’s `start_time`.
3. Count the number of overlapping shifts for each employee.
4. Return the result ordered by `employee_id` in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Use a **self-join** to compare shifts within the same employee.
- Filter for overlapping shifts based on the condition: `t1.end_time > t2.start_time`.
- Group by `employee_id` and count the overlapping shifts.

---

### **Step 2: Self-Join to Find Overlapping Shifts**

First, perform a self-join on the `EmployeeShifts` table to compare shifts within the same employee.

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.employee_id,
    t1.start_time AS shift1_start,
    t1.end_time AS shift1_end,
    t2.start_time AS shift2_start,
    t2.end_time AS shift2_end
FROM
    EmployeeShifts t1
JOIN
    EmployeeShifts t2
ON
    t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
    AND t1.start_time < t2.start_time
    AND t1.end_time > t2.start_time
```

**Explanation:**

- `**JOIN**`: Joins the table to itself to compare shifts.
- `**t1.start_time < t2.start_time**`: Ensures the first shift starts before the second shift.
- `**t1.end_time > t2.start_time**`: Ensures the first shift ends after the second shift starts, indicating overlap.

---

### **Step 3: Count Overlapping Shifts per Employee**

Next, group the results by `employee_id` and count the number of overlapping shifts.

```SQL
WITH OverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        t1.employee_id,
        t1.start_time AS shift1_start,
        t1.end_time AS shift1_end,
        t2.start_time AS shift2_start,
        t2.end_time AS shift2_end
    FROM
        EmployeeShifts t1
    JOIN
        EmployeeShifts t2
    ON
        t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
        AND t1.start_time < t2.start_time
        AND t1.end_time > t2.start_time
)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    COUNT(*) AS overlapping_shifts
FROM
    OverlappingShifts
GROUP BY
    employee_id
ORDER BY
    employee_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**COUNT(*)**`: Counts the number of overlapping shift pairs for each employee.
- `**GROUP BY employee_id**`: Groups the results by employee.
- `**ORDER BY employee_id ASC**`: Orders the result by `employee_id` in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH OverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        t1.employee_id,
        t1.start_time AS shift1_start,
        t1.end_time AS shift1_end,
        t2.start_time AS shift2_start,
        t2.end_time AS shift2_end
    FROM
        EmployeeShifts t1
    JOIN
        EmployeeShifts t2
    ON
        t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
        AND t1.start_time < t2.start_time
        AND t1.end_time > t2.start_time
)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    COUNT(*) AS overlapping_shifts
FROM
    OverlappingShifts
GROUP BY
    employee_id
ORDER BY
    employee_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTE (**`**OverlappingShifts**`**)**: Identifies all pairs of overlapping shifts for each employee.
2. **Grouping and Counting**: Counts the number of overlapping shift pairs per employee.
3. **Ordering**: Sorts the result by `employee_id` in ascending order.

This query returns the desired output, listing each employee’s ID along with the count of their overlapping shifts.
