**Description**

Table: `Signups`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
```

Table: `Confirmations`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
```

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users that requested a confirmation message **twice** within a 24-hour window. Two messages exactly 24 hours apart are considered to be within the window. The `action` does not affect the answer, only the request time.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
+---------+---------------------+
Confirmations table:
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:37:45 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 11:57:30 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-23 00:00:00 | timeout   |
| 6       | 2021-10-23 14:14:14 | confirmed |
| 6       | 2021-10-24 14:14:13 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 2       |
| 3       |
| 6       |
+---------+
Explanation:
User 2 requested two messages within exactly 24 hours of each other, so we include them.
User 3 requested two messages within 6 minutes and 59 seconds of each other, so we include them.
User 6 requested two messages within 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds of each other, so we include them.
User 7 requested two messages within 24 hours and 1 second of each other, so we exclude them from the answer.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining each part so you can understand the logic.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find users who requested confirmation messages twice within a 24-hour window. We need to:

1. Look at the Confirmations table
2. Find pairs of records for the same user
3. Check if these pairs are within 24 hours of each other
4. Return the user_ids that meet this condition

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Basic structure with self-join

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.user_id
FROM Confirmations c1
JOIN Confirmations c2 ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
```

Explanation: We start by joining the Confirmations table with itself to create pairs of confirmation records for the same user. We use two aliases (c1 and c2) to represent the first and second confirmation requests.

## Step 2: Add condition to ensure different confirmation requests

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.user_id
FROM Confirmations c1
JOIN Confirmations c2 ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp
```

Explanation: We add a condition to ensure we're comparing different confirmation requests by requiring that c1's timestamp comes before c2's timestamp. This prevents comparing a record with itself.

## Step 3: Add the 24-hour window condition

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.user_id
FROM Confirmations c1
JOIN Confirmations c2 ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp
  AND c2.time_stamp <= DATE_ADD(c1.time_stamp, INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
```

Explanation: Now we add the crucial 24-hour window condition. The second timestamp (c2) must be less than or equal to 24 hours after the first timestamp (c1). This captures all pairs within a 24-hour window.

## Step 4: Final solution with simplified time difference check

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.user_id
FROM Confirmations c1
JOIN Confirmations c2 ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp
  AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, c1.time_stamp, c2.time_stamp) <= 24*60*60
```

Explanation: This is an alternative approach that uses TIMESTAMPDIFF to calculate the difference in seconds between the two timestamps, ensuring it's less than or equal to 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.user_id
FROM Confirmations c1
JOIN Confirmations c2 ON c1.user_id = c2.user_id
WHERE c1.time_stamp < c2.time_stamp
  AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, c1.time_stamp, c2.time_stamp) <= 24*60*60
```

This query finds all users who requested confirmation messages twice within a 24-hour window by:

1. Joining the Confirmations table with itself to pair records for the same user
2. Ensuring we only compare different confirmation requests (c1 timestamp comes before c2)
3. Checking that the time difference between requests is at most 24 hours (86,400 seconds)
4. Using DISTINCT to ensure each qualifying user appears only once in our results

The query satisfies all the requirements in the problem statement and will correctly identify users like 2, 3, and 6 from the example, while excluding user 7 whose requests were more than 24 hours apart.
