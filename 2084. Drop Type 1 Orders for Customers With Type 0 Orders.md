**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| order_id    | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| order_type  | int  |
+-------------+------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order, the ID of the customer who ordered it, and the order type.
The orders could be of type 0 or type 1.
```

Write a solution to report all the orders based on the following criteria:

- If a customer has **at least one** order of type `0`, do **not** report any order of type `1` from that customer.
- Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 12       | 2           | 1          |
| 21       | 3           | 1          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Output:
+----------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_type |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 31       | 4           | 1          |
| 32       | 4           | 1          |
| 1        | 1           | 0          |
| 2        | 1           | 0          |
| 11       | 2           | 0          |
| 22       | 3           | 0          |
+----------+-------------+------------+
Explanation:
Customer 1 has two orders of type 0. We return both of them.
Customer 2 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 3 has one order of type 0 and one order of type 1. We only return the order of type 0.
Customer 4 has two orders of type 1. We return both of them.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step and explain each part clearly.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Report all orders of type 0, regardless of customer
2. Report orders of type 1, but only if the customer has no orders of type 0
3. Essentially, for any customer who has at least one type 0 order, we ignore all their type 1 orders

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Identify customers who have type 0 orders

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0;
```

Explanation: This query gives us a list of all the customers who have at least one order of type 0. These are the customers whose type 1 orders we will exclude.

## Step 2: Filter orders based on the criteria

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0
   OR (order_type = 1 AND customer_id NOT IN (
       SELECT customer_id
       FROM Orders
       WHERE order_type = 0
   ));
```

Explanation: This query returns two groups of orders:

- All orders of type 0 (first condition)
- Orders of type 1, but only for customers who don't appear in our subquery of customers with type 0 orders

## Step 3: Format the result to match the expected output

```SQL
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_type
FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0
   OR (order_type = 1 AND customer_id NOT IN (
       SELECT customer_id
       FROM Orders
       WHERE order_type = 0
   ));
```

Explanation: We explicitly list the columns to return in our query, making sure they match the expected output format.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_type
FROM Orders
WHERE order_type = 0
   OR (order_type = 1 AND customer_id NOT IN (
       SELECT customer_id
       FROM Orders
       WHERE order_type = 0
   ));
```

This query:

1. Includes all orders of type 0
2. Includes orders of type 1, but only for customers who don't have any orders of type 0
3. Uses a NOT IN subquery to filter customers who have type 0 orders

Alternative approaches could use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS or LEFT JOIN techniques, but this solution is straightforward and efficient for the given problem.
