Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| manager_id  | int      |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
In SQL, employee_id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).
```

Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than `$30000` and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the `Employees` table, but the reports still have their `manager_id` set to the manager that left.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
+-------------+

Explanation:
The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).
Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).
Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.
```

# Finding Employees with Low Salaries and Departed Managers

To solve this problem, I need to identify employees who:

1. Earn strictly less than $30,000, and
2. Have a manager who is no longer with the company (manager_id doesn't exist in the employee table)

## Approach

1. **Filter Low Salaries**: First select employees with salary < 30000
2. **Check Manager Status**: Verify their manager_id is not null and doesn't exist in the employee table
3. **Order Results**: Sort by employee_id as required

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000
AND manager_id IS NOT NULL
AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

## Explanation

1. `salary < 30000` filters for low-paid employees
2. `manager_id IS NOT NULL` ensures we only consider employees with managers
3. `manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)` confirms the manager has left
4. In the example:
    - Employee 1 (Kalel) has salary 21241 (<30000) but manager 11 still exists
    - Employee 11 (Joziah) has salary 28485 (<30000) and manager 6 doesn't exist
    - Result correctly identifies only employee 11

This solution efficiently combines salary filtering with manager verification to identify the target employees.
