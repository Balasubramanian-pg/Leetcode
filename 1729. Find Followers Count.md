Table: `Followers`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the IDs of a user and a follower in a social media app where the follower follows the user.
```

Write a solution that will, for each user, return the number of followers.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Followers table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |
+---------+-------------+
Output:
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | followers_count|
+---------+----------------+
| 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1              |
| 2       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
Explanation:
The followers of 0 are {1}
The followers of 1 are {0}
The followers of 2 are {0,1}
```

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of followers each user has from the given Followers table. The solution involves aggregating the data by user and counting their respective followers.

### Approach

1. **Group By User ID**: We group the data by `user_id` to process each user's followers individually.
2. **Count Followers**: For each user group, we count the number of distinct `follower_id` entries. Since the primary key ensures each (user_id, follower_id) pair is unique, we can directly count the entries without worrying about duplicates.
3. **Order Results**: Finally, we order the result by `user_id` in ascending order to meet the problem's requirements.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY user_id;
```

### Explanation

- **Grouping By User ID**: By grouping the data using `user_id`, we can handle each user's followers separately.
- **Counting Followers**: The `COUNT(follower_id)` function counts the number of followers for each user. Given the primary key constraint, each entry in the group is a unique follower, ensuring accurate counts.
- **Ordering**: The results are ordered by `user_id` in ascending order to provide a sorted output as required.

This approach efficiently aggregates and counts the followers for each user, ensuring the solution is both correct and optimal.
