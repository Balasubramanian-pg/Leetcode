**Description**

Table: `Store`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| bill_id     | int  |
| customer_id | int  |
| amount      | int  |
+-------------+------+
bill_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the amount of one bill and the customer associated with it.
```

Write a solution to report the number of customers who had **at least one** bill with an amount **strictly greater** than `500`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Store table:
+---------+-------------+--------+
| bill_id | customer_id | amount |
+---------+-------------+--------+
| 6       | 1           | 549    |
| 8       | 1           | 834    |
| 4       | 2           | 394    |
| 11      | 3           | 657    |
| 13      | 3           | 257    |
+---------+-------------+--------+
Output:
+------------+
| rich_count |
+------------+
| 2          |
+------------+
Explanation:
Customer 1 has two bills with amounts strictly greater than 500.
Customer 2 does not have any bills with an amount strictly greater than 500.
Customer 3 has one bill with an amount strictly greater than 500.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining the logic along the way.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Count how many unique customers have at least one bill with an amount strictly greater than 500
2. Return this count as "rich_count"

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Filter bills greater than 500

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Store
WHERE amount > 500;
```

Explanation: First, we filter the Store table to only include rows where the amount is strictly greater than 500. This gives us all bills that meet our criteria.

## Step 2: Extract unique customers from the filtered bills

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM Store
WHERE amount > 500;
```

Explanation: We only want to count each customer once, regardless of how many bills over 500 they have. The DISTINCT keyword ensures we get each customer_id only once from our filtered results.

## Step 3: Count the number of unique customers

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM Store
WHERE amount > 500;
```

Explanation: Now we're counting how many unique customer_id values appear in our filtered results. This gives us the number of customers who have at least one bill greater than 500.

## Step 4: Format the result with the required column name

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS rich_count
FROM Store
WHERE amount > 500;
```

Explanation: We've added the AS clause to name our count result as "rich_count" as specified in the problem requirements.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS rich_count
FROM Store
WHERE amount > 500;
```

This query:

1. Filters the Store table to only include bills with amount > 500
2. Counts the distinct customer_id values from these filtered rows
3. Names the result column "rich_count"

The solution is concise and efficient, using a straightforward approach that directly addresses the problem statement.
