**Description**

Table: `NewYork`

```Markdown
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| student_id  | int  |
| score       | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the score of one student from New York University in an exam.
```

Table: `California`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| student_id  | int  |
| score       | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the score of one student from California University in an exam.
```

There is a competition between New York University and  
California University. The competition is held between the same number  
of students from both universities. The university that has more **excellent students** wins the competition. If the two universities have the same number of **excellent students**, the competition ends in a draw.

An **excellent student** is a student that scored `90%` or more in the exam.

Return:

- **"New York University"** if New York University wins the competition.
- **"California University"** if California University wins the competition.
- **"No Winner"** if the competition ends in a draw.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
NewYork table:

+------------+-------+
California table:
+------------+-------+

+------------+-------+
| 2          | 89    |

+------------+-------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| winner              |
+---------------------+
| New York University |
+---------------------+
Explanation:
New York University has 1 excellent student, and California University has 0 excellent students.
```

+------------+-------+
Output:
+-----------------------+
| winner                |
+-----------------------+
| California University |
+-----------------------+
Explanation:
New York University has 0 excellent students, and California University has 1 excellent student.
```

**Example 3:**

```Plain
Input:
NewYork table:
+------------+-------+
| student_id | score |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 89    |

+------------+-------+
California table:
+------------+-------+
| student_id | score |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 87    |
| 3          | 99    |
+------------+-------+
Output:
+-----------+
| winner    |
+-----------+
| No Winner |
+-----------+
Explanation:
Both New York University and California University have 1 excellent student.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step and explain the logic clearly.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Count the number of "excellent students" (scoring 90% or more) from each university
2. Compare the counts to determine the winner
3. Return "New York University" if they have more excellent students
4. Return "California University" if they have more excellent students
5. Return "No Winner" if both have the same number of excellent students

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Count excellent students from New York University

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ny_excellent_count
FROM NewYork
WHERE score >= 90;
```

Explanation: This query counts how many students from New York University scored 90 or higher. We're using the WHERE clause to filter for only those students with excellent scores.

## Step 2: Count excellent students from California University

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cal_excellent_count
FROM California
WHERE score >= 90;
```

Explanation: Similarly, this query counts how many students from California University scored 90 or higher.

## Step 3: Combine the counts into a single query using subqueries

```SQL
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM NewYork WHERE score >= 90) AS ny_excellent_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM California WHERE score >= 90) AS cal_excellent_count;
```

Explanation: We're using subqueries to get both counts in a single row. This makes it easier to compare them in the next step.

## Step 4: Add the CASE statement to determine the winner

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM NewYork WHERE score >= 90) >
             (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM California WHERE score >= 90) THEN 'New York University'
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM NewYork WHERE score >= 90) <
             (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM California WHERE score >= 90) THEN 'California University'
        ELSE 'No Winner'
    END AS winner;
```

Explanation: We use a CASE statement to compare the counts and return the appropriate string based on which university has more excellent students. If they have the same number, we return "No Winner".

## Step 5: Optimize by using subqueries in FROM clause (Final Solution)

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN ny.excellent_count > cal.excellent_count THEN 'New York University'
        WHEN ny.excellent_count < cal.excellent_count THEN 'California University'
        ELSE 'No Winner'
    END AS winner
FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(*) AS excellent_count FROM NewYork WHERE score >= 90) AS ny,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) AS excellent_count FROM California WHERE score >= 90) AS cal;
```

Explanation: This is a more efficient version where we calculate the counts once in subqueries and then reference them in the CASE statement. The subqueries in the FROM clause create temporary tables that we can use in our main query.

## Final Solution (Alternative using cross join syntax):

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN n1.cnt > n2.cnt THEN 'New York University'
        WHEN n1.cnt < n2.cnt THEN 'California University'
        ELSE 'No Winner'
    END AS winner
FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM NewYork WHERE score >= 90) AS n1,
    (SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt FROM California WHERE score >= 90) AS n2;
```

This final solution:

1. Counts excellent students from New York in a subquery (n1)
2. Counts excellent students from California in a subquery (n2)
3. Uses a cross join (the comma in the FROM clause) to combine these single-value tables
4. Uses a CASE statement to compare the counts and determine the winner
5. Returns the appropriate string as the "winner" column

The use of COUNT(1) instead of COUNT(*) is a stylistic choice - both work the same way in this context.
