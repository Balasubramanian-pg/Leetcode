**Description**

Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| team_id       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
```

Write a solution to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
Explanation:
Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employee with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.
```

I'll analyze both SQL solutions that solve the problem of finding the team size for each employee.

## Problem Overview

We need to calculate how many employees are in each team and then map that number back to each individual employee.

## Solution 1: Group By + Equi-Join

```SQL
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT team_id, COUNT(1) AS team_size
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT employee_id, team_size
FROM
    Employee
    JOIN T USING (team_id);
```

### How it works:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Creates a temporary table `T` that calculates the size of each team
    - `SELECT team_id, COUNT(1) AS team_size` - Counts employees per team
    - `GROUP BY 1` - Groups by the first column (team_id)
2. **Join Operation**: Combines the original Employee table with the team size data
    - `JOIN T USING (team_id)` - Matches employees with their team size using the shared team_id column
    - Result includes employee_id from the Employee table and team_size from the T table

### Workflow trace with example data:

First, the CTE calculates:

```Plain
T table:
+------------+------------+
| team_id    | team_size  |
+------------+------------+
|     7      |     1      |
|     8      |     3      |
|     9      |     2      |
+------------+------------+
```

Then, the join produces:

```Plain
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
```

## Solution 2: Left Join with Self-Join

```SQL
SELECT e1.employee_id, COUNT(1) AS team_size
FROM
    Employee AS e1
    LEFT JOIN Employee AS e2 USING (team_id)
GROUP BY 1;
```

### How it works:

1. **Self-Join**: The Employee table is joined with itself
    - `Employee AS e1 LEFT JOIN Employee AS e2 USING (team_id)`
    - For each employee in e1, this matches all employees in e2 with the same team_id
2. **Aggregation**: Counts the total matches per employee
    - `COUNT(1)` counts how many rows match for each employee_id
    - `GROUP BY 1` groups by the first column (employee_id)

### Workflow trace with example data:

When employee_id=1 (team_id=8) from e1 is joined with all e2 rows:

- Matches with employee_id=1 (team_id=8)
- Matches with employee_id=2 (team_id=8)
- Matches with employee_id=3 (team_id=8)  
    So COUNT(1)=3 for employee_id=1  
    

When employee_id=4 (team_id=7) from e1 is joined:

- Only matches with employee_id=4 (team_id=7)  
    So COUNT(1)=1 for employee_id=4  
    

## Comparison of Approaches

### Solution 1 (Group By + Equi-Join):

- **Pros**: More intuitive, separates the calculation into distinct steps
- **Cons**: Requires creating a temporary table (CTE)
- **Performance**: Often better for larger datasets as it only counts each team size once

### Solution 2 (Left Join):

- **Pros**: More concise, doesn't require a temporary table
- **Cons**: Conceptually more complex as it uses a self-join
- **Performance**: May be less efficient for large datasets as it potentially creates larger intermediate result sets

Both solutions produce identical results for this problem, but they represent different SQL problem-solving approaches. Solution 1 follows a "calculate then join" pattern, while Solution 2 uses a "join then calculate" pattern.
