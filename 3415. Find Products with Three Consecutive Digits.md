**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and name of a product.
```

Write a solution to find all **products** whose names contain a **sequence of exactly three digits in a row**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `product_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

products table:

```Plain
+-------------+--------------------+
| product_id  | name               |
+-------------+--------------------+
| 1           | ABC123XYZ          |
| 2           | A12B34C            |
| 3           | Product56789       |
| 4           | NoDigitsHere       |
| 5           | 789Product         |
| 6           | Item003Description |
| 7           | Product12X34       |
+-------------+--------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+--------------------+
| product_id  | name               |
+-------------+--------------------+
| 1           | ABC123XYZ          |
| 5           | 789Product         |
| 6           | Item003Description |
+-------------+--------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Product 1: ABC123XYZ contains the digits 123.
- Product 5: 789Product contains the digits 789.
- Product 6: Item003Description contains 003, which is exactly three digits.

**Note:**

- Results are ordered by `product_id` in ascending order.
- Only products with exactly three consecutive digits in their names are included in the result.

## Solutions

<Inner Monologue>  
This problem asks us to find all products where the name contains exactly 3 consecutive digits in a row. Let's break this down:  

1. We need to find a pattern of three digits ([0-9]) in a row within the product name.
2. We need to return the product_id and name of these products.
3. The results should be ordered by product_id in ascending order.

This is a perfect use case for pattern matching with regular expressions (REGEXP or LIKE with pattern matching).

In SQL, different database systems have different syntax for regular expressions:

- In MySQL, we can use the REGEXP function.
- In PostgreSQL, we can use the ~ or ~* operators.
- In Oracle, we can use REGEXP_LIKE.
- In SQL Server, we can use LIKE with pattern matching.

Since the problem doesn't specify which database system we should use, and I was told to assume MySQL unless specified, I'll use MySQL's REGEXP function.

The pattern we want to match is three consecutive digits: [0-9][0-9][0-9] or \d{3} in regex notation.

Let's write the SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[0-9][0-9][0-9]'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Alternatively, we could use:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '\\d{3}'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Let's check with the example data:

1. "ABC123XYZ" contains "123", which is three consecutive digits. So this should be included.
2. "A12B34C" contains "12" and "34", which are two-digit sequences, not three. This shouldn't be included.
3. "Product56789" contains "56789", which is five consecutive digits. Since we're looking for "exactly three digits in a row", this should still match for "567" and for "678" and for "789". But it's not clear if the problem wants us to match products with exactly three consecutive digits, or at least three consecutive digits. Based on the explanation provided, I believe it is asking for products that have a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not more or less. But products with more than three digits in a row would also contain exactly three digits in a row, so I believe it should be included.
4. "NoDigitsHere" contains no digits, so this shouldn't be included.
5. "789Product" contains "789", which is three consecutive digits. So this should be included.
6. "Item003Description" contains "003", which is three consecutive digits. So this should be included.
7. "Product12X34" contains "12" and "34", which are two-digit sequences, not three. This shouldn't be included.

But the expected output doesn't include product ID 3, which means the problem is looking for products that have a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not products with three or more consecutive digits. This means we need to modify our regular expression to exclude products with more than three consecutive digits in a row.

Let's modify the SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Actually, this isn't quite right. The above regex means "three digits at the beginning or after a non-digit, followed by a non-digit or the end". But it would miss cases like "ABC123" because the regex expects something after the three digits, and it would miss cases like "123XYZ" because the regex expects something before the three digits.

Let's revise:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)' OR name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}([^0-9]|$)' OR name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}$'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

That's a bit more complicated, and I'm not sure if MySQL's REGEXP can handle it. Let's try a different approach:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[0-9]{3}' AND NOT name REGEXP '[0-9]{4}'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But this wouldn't work either because a product name like "A123B456C" contains two separate sequences of three digits, but it doesn't contain a sequence of four digits. So it would incorrectly match.

Let's take a step back. The problem is asking for products where the name contains "a sequence of exactly three digits in a row". This means we need to match a sequence of three digits that is not part of a longer sequence of digits.

In regex terms, we want to match a sequence of three digits that is either:

1. At the beginning of the string, followed by a non-digit character
2. Preceded by a non-digit character and followed by a non-digit character
3. Preceded by a non-digit character and at the end of the string

Let's express this in a regex:

```LLVM
(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)
```

But wait, what if the product name is just three digits, like "123"? This regex wouldn't match that. So we should also match a string that consists of exactly three digits:

```CSS
^[0-9]{3}$|^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{3}$
```

Let's try this in the SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}$|^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{3}$'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

However, I think the problem with this approach is that it's checking for a positive look-ahead and look-behind, which might not be supported in MySQL's REGEXP.

Let's revisit the expected output and the explanations:

1. "ABC123XYZ" contains "123", which is three consecutive digits. Included.
2. "789Product" contains "789", which is three consecutive digits. Included.
3. "Item003Description" contains "003", which is three consecutive digits. Included.

But not:  
2. "A12B34C" contains "12" and "34", which are two-digit sequences, not three. Not included.  
3. "Product56789" contains "56789", which is five consecutive digits, not three. Not included.  
4. "NoDigitsHere" contains no digits. Not included.  
7. "Product12X34" contains "12" and "34", which are two-digit sequences, not three. Not included.  

It looks like the problem is asking for product names that contain a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, and not more or less.

Now, Products "2", "4", and "7" are clear, they don't contain three consecutive digits.

For Product "3" ("Product56789"), the name contains a sequence of five consecutive digits. While this does contain a sequence of three consecutive digits (e.g., "567", "678", "789"), it seems that the problem is asking for a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not a sequence that contains three consecutive digits.

Actually, I re-read the problem statement and it states: "find all products whose names contain a sequence of exactly three digits in a row".

This implies that we're looking for a sequence of digits, and the sequence has to be exactly 3 digits long. So the sequence could be surrounded by non-digit characters or be at the beginning/end of the string.

Given this understanding, let's reapproach the problem.

In regex terms, we want to match a sequence of three digits that is:

1. Either at the beginning of the string or preceded by a non-digit
2. Exactly three digits
3. Either at the end of the string or followed by a non-digit

This can be expressed as:

```Plain
(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])
```

However, MySQL's REGEXP doesn't support look-ahead or look-behind, which makes this a bit more challenging. Let's try a different approach:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[[:<:]][0-9]{3}[[:>:]]'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

In MySQL, `[[:<:]]` and `[[:>:]]` are word boundary markers. They match the position where a word character (alphanumeric or underscore) is not preceded or followed, respectively, by another word character.

But I'm not sure if this will work correctly because these markers mark word boundaries, not digit boundaries.

Let's try a different approach using a combination of LIKE and NOT LIKE:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    (name LIKE '%0[0-9][0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9]0[0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9][0-9]0%' OR
     name LIKE '%1[0-9][0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9]1[0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9][0-9]1%' OR
     ... [repeat for all digits] ... OR
     name LIKE '%9[0-9][0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9]9[0-9]%' OR name LIKE '%[0-9][0-9]9%')
    AND NOT (name LIKE '%[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]%')
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But this is very verbose and might not be practical. Let's go back to the regexp approach:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[[:<:]][0-9]{3}[[:>:]]'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Actually, let's use a simpler approach with REGEXP. We can check if the name contains a sequence of three digits, and then check that the name doesn't contain a sequence of four digits:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[0-9]{3}' AND NOT name REGEXP '[0-9]{4}'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But wait, this approach would miss cases like "A123B456C" where there are two separate sequences of three digits, but no sequence of four digits.

Let's go back to the original idea:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Wait, I just realized. The word boundary markers in MySQL's REGEXP (`[[:<:]]` and `[[:>:]]`) would actually work for this. They mark the boundary between a word character and a non-word character or the beginning/end of the string. Digits are word characters. So, if we want to match a sequence of three digits that's not part of a longer sequence of digits, we can use:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[[:<:]][0-9]{3}[[:>:]]'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

This should match a sequence of three digits that's not part of a longer sequence of word characters. But it might match sequences like "ABC123_XYZ" because the underscore is considered a word character. But the problem doesn't mention underscores, so this might be fine.

Actually I'm not sure if this will work with MySQL. MySQL 8.0 deprecated the word boundary markers. Let's use an alternative:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '\\b[0-9]{3}\\b'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Here, `\\b` is a word boundary marker in regex, which should achieve the same effect.

But again, this might match cases like "a123_b" because the underscore is considered a word character.

Hmm, we're facing a bit of a challenge here. Firstly, the problem's requirement seems ambiguous: Does it want products with a sequence of exactly three digits, or products with a sequence of exactly three digits that's not part of a longer sequence of digits? Based on the list of expected outputs, it's the latter.

Let me think about the problem again with the expected outputs:

1. "ABC123XYZ" contains "123", which is a sequence of exactly three digits. It's included.
2. "789Product" contains "789", which is a sequence of exactly three digits. It's included.
3. "Item003Description" contains "003", which is a sequence of exactly three digits. It's included.

But not:  
2. "A12B34C" contains "12" and "34", which are sequences of digits less than three. Not included.  
3. "Product56789" contains "56789", which is a sequence of more than three digits. Not included.  
4. "NoDigitsHere" contains no digits. Not included.  
7. "Product12X34" contains "12" and "34", which are sequences of digits less than three. Not included.  

This suggests the problem is asking to find product names that contain a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, and this sequence should not be part of a longer sequence of digits.

When I say "a sequence of digits", I'm referring to a contiguous sequence of characters, all of which are digits. For example, in "ABC123XYZ", "123" is a sequence of digits. In "A12B34C", "12" and "34" are sequences of digits. In "Product56789", "56789" is a sequence of digits.

Given this understanding, let's try to formulate a regex that matches a sequence of exactly three digits, not part of a longer sequence of digits. This would be a sequence of three digits, not preceded or followed by a digit.

In many regex flavors, this would be:

```Plain
(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])
```

However, as I mentioned, MySQL's REGEXP doesn't fully support lookahead or lookbehind. Let's see if there's a way to achieve this.

One way would be to use a combination of LIKE statements:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE (
    name LIKE '%0__' OR name LIKE '%_0_' OR name LIKE '%__0%' OR
    name LIKE '%1__' OR name LIKE '%_1_' OR name LIKE '%__1%' OR
    ... [repeat for all digits] ...
) AND NOT (
    name LIKE '%0___' OR name LIKE '%_0__' OR name LIKE '%__0_' OR name LIKE '%___0%' OR
    name LIKE '%1___' OR name LIKE '%_1__' OR name LIKE '%__1_' OR name LIKE '%___1%' OR
    ... [repeat for all digits] ...
)
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But this would be very verbose and might not be practical.

Actually, looking at the expected output again, I notice that "Product56789" is not included. But it contains the sequences "567", "678", and "789", each of which is a sequence of exactly three digits.

So I think the problem is asking to find product names that contain a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not more and not less. Such a sequence would be delimited by non-digit characters or the beginning/end of the string.

Let's revisit the idea of using word boundary markers in MySQL's REGEXP. In MySQL 5.7 and earlier, we could use `[[:<:]]` and `[[:>:]]`. In MySQL 8.0 and later, we could use `\\b`.

```SQL
-- For MySQL 5.7 and earlier
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '[[:<:]][0-9]{3}[[:>:]]'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;

-- For MySQL 8.0 and later
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '\\b[0-9]{3}\\b'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But word boundary markers might not work as expected because they delimit word characters, not specifically digits. A word character is an alphanumeric character or an underscore.

Let's try an alternative approach:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    (name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits at start
     name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits in middle
     name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}$' OR  -- Three digits at end
     name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}$')  -- Only three digits
    AND NOT name REGEXP '[0-9]{4}'  -- No four consecutive digits
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

But this may not be correct. For example, a product name like "A123B456C" would match the second condition but also the "NOT name REGEXP '[0-9]{4}'" condition, because it doesn't have four consecutive digits. But it has two separate sequences of three digits, which is not what we want to exclude. We want to exclude products with sequences of more than three consecutive digits, like "A1234B".

Actually, if we go back to the expected outputs, "Product56789" should not be included, even though it contains the sequences "567", "678", and "789", each of which is a sequence of exactly three digits. This suggests the problem is indeed asking to find product names that contain a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not part of a longer sequence of digits.

I'm going to try a different approach in MySQL using regex:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    (name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits at start, followed by non-digit
     name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits in middle, surrounded by non-digits
     name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}$' OR  -- Three digits at end, preceded by non-digit
     name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}$')  -- Only three digits
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

This should match products where the name contains a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not part of a longer sequence of digits.

Tracing this with the sample data:

1. "ABC123XYZ": Matches the second condition (three digits in middle, surrounded by non-digits). Included.
2. "A12B34C": Doesn't match any condition (no sequence of three digits). Not included.
3. "Product56789": Doesn't match any condition (the sequence "56789" is more than three digits). Not included.
4. "NoDigitsHere": Doesn't match any condition (no digits). Not included.
5. "789Product": Matches the first condition (three digits at start, followed by non-digit). Included.
6. "Item003Description": Matches the second condition (three digits in middle, surrounded by non-digits). Included.
7. "Product12X34": Doesn't match any condition (no sequence of three digits). Not included.

This matches the expected output, so I think we're good.

Let's verify the MySQL syntax:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits at start, followed by non-digit
    name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]' OR  -- Three digits in middle, surrounded by non-digits
    name REGEXP '[^0-9][0-9]{3}$' OR  -- Three digits at end, preceded by non-digit
    name REGEXP '^[0-9]{3}$'  -- Only three digits
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

This should be valid MySQL syntax. However, I'm a bit skeptical about the way I've split the regex into multiple conditions. Let's try to combine them into a single regex:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

This should be equivalent to the previous SQL statement and might be more efficient.

However, to ensure maximum compatibility with different versions of MySQL, we might adjust the regex pattern:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

I'm pretty sure that this should correctly solve the problem. But let me verify it one more time:

1. `^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Matches three digits at the beginning of the string, followed by a non-digit. This would match "789Product".
2. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Matches three digits surrounded by non-digits. This would match "ABC123XYZ" or "Item003Description".
3. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}$`: Matches three digits at the end of the string, preceded by a non-digit. This would match "ABC123".
4. `^[0-9]{3}$`: Matches a string consisting of exactly three digits. This would match "123".

I believe this should correctly identify products that contain a sequence of exactly three consecutive digits, not part of a longer sequence of digits.

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Oh, I just realized a product name like "xyz123" wouldn't be matched by any of our conditions. Let's fix this:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Wait, I repeated a condition. Let's correct this:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3}$)'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

I'm still missing a condition: a product name like "xyz123" wouldn't be matched. This is a case where three digits are at the end, but they're not preceded by a non-digit (because the condition `[^0-9][0-9]{3}$` requires a non-digit before the three digits). Let's correct this:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE
    name REGEXP '(^[0-9]{3}[^0-9])|([^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9])|(^[0-9]{3}$)|([^0-9][0-9]{3}$)|(^[0-9]{3})'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

Hmm, we have overlapping conditions. Let's reorganize:

1. `^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits at the start, followed by a non-digit.
2. `^[0-9]{3}$`: Exactly three digits.
3. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits in the middle, surrounded by non-digits.
4. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}$`: Three digits at the end, preceded by a non-digit.

But we're still missing a case: three digits at the end, not preceded by a non-digit. This would be something like "ABC123" or "123".

Actually, let's reapproach this:

1. `^[0-9]{3}$`: Exactly three digits (e.g., "123").
2. `^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits at the start, followed by a non-digit (e.g., "123ABC").
3. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}$`: Three digits at the end, preceded by a non-digit (e.g., "ABC123").
4. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits in the middle, surrounded by non-digits (e.g., "ABC123XYZ").

Wait, what about "ABC123"? It should match, but it doesn't fit condition 3 because "ABC" isn't a single non-digit (it's three non-digits).

Let's redefine the conditions:

1. `^[0-9]{3}$`: Exactly three digits (e.g., "123").
2. `^[0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits at the start, followed by a non-digit (e.g., "123ABC").
3. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}$`: Three digits at the end, preceded by a non-digit (e.g., "A123").
4. `[^0-9][0-9]{3}[^0-9]`: Three digits in the middle, surrounded by non-digits (e.g., "A123X").

But this still missing some cases. What about "ABC123"? It should match, but it doesn't fit condition 3 because "ABC" isn't a single non-digit. Condition 3 should be:

1. `[^0-9].*[0-9]{3}$`: Three digits at the end, preceded by any string that starts with a non-digit.

But that's too broad. This would match "ABC12345", which we don't want.

Let's step back and think differently. The problem is asking to find products whose names contain a sequence of exactly three digits in a row. That means the sequence is not part of a longer sequence of digits. So, we want to find a sequence of digits that is exactly 3 digits long.

In regex terms, this means we're looking for a sequence of three digits that is not preceded or followed by a digit. We can express this as:

```Plain
(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])
```

This says: "Match three digits that are either at the beginning of the string or preceded by a non-digit, and either at the end of the string or followed by a non-digit."

Let's try to use this in MySQL:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

This should match the products we're looking for. Tracing with the sample data:

1. "ABC123XYZ": Matches because "123" is a sequence of three digits, preceded by "C" (a non-digit) and followed by "X" (a non-digit). Included.
2. "A12B34C": Doesn't match (no sequence of three digits). Not included.
3. "Product56789": Doesn't match because "567", "678", and "789" are all part of a longer sequence of digits ("56789"). Not included.
4. "NoDigitsHere": Doesn't match (no digits). Not included.
5. "789Product": Matches because "789" is a sequence of three digits, at the beginning of the string and followed by "P" (a non-digit). Included.
6. "Item003Description": Matches because "003" is a sequence of three digits, preceded by "m" (a non-digit) and followed by "D" (a non-digit). Included.
7. "Product12X34": Doesn't match (no sequence of three digits). Not included.

This matches the expected output! But let's double check our regex syntax for MySQL:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

I believe this solution is correct. However, I'm not 100% sure if MySQL's REGEXP supports this kind of pattern. If it doesn't, we might need to use a more complex SQL statement with multiple LIKE conditions. However, I'll go ahead with the solution as is, since we're assuming MySQL compatability.

I'm confident in this solution:

```SQL
SELECT product_id, name
FROM Products
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])'
ORDER BY product_id ASC;
```

<SQL Solution>  
```sql  
SELECT product_id, name  
FROM Products  
WHERE name REGEXP '(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])'  
ORDER BY product_id ASC;  
```  
</SQL Solution>  

This solution uses a regular expression pattern to find products whose names contain exactly three consecutive digits that are not part of a longer sequence of digits. Let me explain how it works:

1. The `REGEXP` operator is used to perform pattern matching against the `name` column
2. The pattern `(^|[^0-9])[0-9]{3}($|[^0-9])` breaks down as follows:
    - `(^|[^0-9])`: Match either the start of the string (`^`) OR a non-digit character `[^0-9]`
    - `[0-9]{3}`: Match exactly three consecutive digit characters
    - `($|[^0-9])`: Match either the end of the string (`$`) OR a non-digit character `[^0-9]`

This pattern ensures that we match sequences that are:

- Exactly three digits long
- Either at the beginning of the string or preceded by a non-digit character
- Either at the end of the string or followed by a non-digit character

This prevents matching longer sequences of digits (like "56789" in "Product56789") while correctly identifying standalone three-digit sequences.

Tracing through the examples:

- "ABC123XYZ" matches because "123" is a sequence of three digits surrounded by non-digits
- "789Product" matches because "789" is a sequence of three digits at the start followed by a non-digit
- "Item003Description" matches because "003" is a sequence of three digits surrounded by non-digits
- "Product56789" doesn't match because "567", "678", and "789" are all part of a longer sequence of digits
- "A12B34C" doesn't match because it only has sequences of two digits
- "Product12X34" doesn't match for the same reason

The results are then ordered by product_id in ascending order as required.
