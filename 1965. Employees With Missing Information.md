Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
```

Table: `Salaries`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the salary of the employee whose ID is employee_id.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of all the employees with **missing information**. The information of an employee is missing if:

- The employee's **name** is missing, or
- The employee's **salary** is missing.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id` **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | name     |
+-------------+----------+
| 2           | Crew     |
| 4           | Haven    |
| 5           | Kristian |
+-------------+----------+
Salaries table:
+-------------+--------+
| employee_id | salary |
+-------------+--------+
| 5           | 76071  |
| 1           | 22517  |
| 4           | 63539  |
+-------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 2           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
Employees 1, 2, 4, and 5 are working at this company.
The name of employee 1 is missing.
The salary of employee 2 is missing.
```

# Finding Employees with Missing Information

To solve this problem, I need to identify employees who have either:

1. No name in the Employees table (but exist in Salaries), or
2. No salary in the Salaries table (but exist in Employees)

## Approach

1. **Full Outer Join**: Combine all employee_ids from both tables (simulated with UNION in MySQL)
2. **Find Missing Data**: Identify IDs present in one table but not the other
3. **Order Results**: Sort by employee_id as required

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT employee_id
FROM (
    SELECT employee_id FROM Employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT employee_id FROM Salaries
) AS combined
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

## Explanation

1. The subquery combines all employee_ids from both tables
2. GROUP BY groups them by employee_id
3. HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 finds IDs that appear only once (meaning missing from one table)
4. ORDER BY sorts the results
5. In the example:
    - Employee 1: in Salaries but not Employees (missing name)
    - Employee 2: in Employees but not Salaries (missing salary)
    - Employees 4 and 5 appear in both tables (complete info)

This solution efficiently identifies employees with missing information by detecting IDs that don't appear in both tables.
