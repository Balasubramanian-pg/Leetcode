**Description**

Table: `Weather`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| city_id     | int  |
| day         | date |
| degree      | int  |
+-------------+------+
(city_id, day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table contains the degree of the weather of a city on a certain day.
All the degrees are recorded in the year 2022.
```

Write a solution to report the day that has the maximum  
recorded degree in each city. If the maximum degree was recorded for the  
same city multiple times, return the earliest day among them.  

Return the result table ordered by `city_id` in **ascending order**.

TheÂ result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Weather table:
+---------+------------+--------+
| city_id | day        | degree |
+---------+------------+--------+
| 1       | 2022-01-07 | -12    |
| 1       | 2022-03-07 | 5      |
| 1       | 2022-07-07 | 24     |
| 2       | 2022-08-07 | 37     |
| 2       | 2022-08-17 | 37     |
| 3       | 2022-02-07 | -7     |
| 3       | 2022-12-07 | -6     |
+---------+------------+--------+
Output:
+---------+------------+--------+
| city_id | day        | degree |
+---------+------------+--------+
| 1       | 2022-07-07 | 24     |
| 2       | 2022-08-07 | 37     |
| 3       | 2022-12-07 | -6     |
+---------+------------+--------+
Explanation:
For city 1, the maximum degree was recorded on 2022-07-07 with 24 degrees.
For city 2, the maximum degree was recorded on 2022-08-07 and 2022-08-17 with 37 degrees. We choose the earlier date (2022-08-07).
For city 3, the maximum degree was recorded on 2022-12-07 with -6 degrees.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to find the day with the maximum temperature for each city.
-- If there are multiple days with the same maximum temperature, we take the earliest one.
-- Results should be ordered by city_id in ascending order.
```

Explanation: This problem asks us to find the maximum temperature recorded for each city, and if multiple days have that same maximum temperature, we should select the earliest date. We need to return the city_id, the day, and the degree, ordered by city_id.

Step 2: Identifying the Maximum Degree for Each City

```SQL
SELECT city_id, MAX(degree) as max_degree
FROM Weather
GROUP BY city_id
```

Explanation: First, we need to find the maximum temperature recorded for each city. We do this by grouping the data by city_id and using the MAX() function to get the highest degree value for each group.

Step 3: Joining Back to Get Complete Records

```SQL
SELECT w.city_id, w.day, w.degree
FROM Weather w
JOIN (
    SELECT city_id, MAX(degree) as max_degree
    FROM Weather
    GROUP BY city_id
) t ON w.city_id = t.city_id AND w.degree = t.max_degree
```

Explanation: Now we join the original table with our subquery to get back the complete records (including the day) where the degree matches the maximum degree for each city. This gives us all days that have the maximum temperature for each city.

Step 4: Handling Multiple Days with Same Maximum Degree

```SQL
SELECT w.city_id, w.day, w.degree
FROM Weather w
JOIN (
    SELECT city_id, MAX(degree) as max_degree
    FROM Weather
    GROUP BY city_id
) t ON w.city_id = t.city_id AND w.degree = t.max_degree
ORDER BY w.city_id, w.day
```

Explanation: For cities that have multiple days with the same maximum temperature, we need to select the earliest day. We do this by ordering the results by city_id and day, which will put the earliest date first for each city.

Step 5: Selecting the Earliest Day for Each City

```SQL
WITH MaxTemps AS (
    SELECT city_id, MAX(degree) as max_degree
    FROM Weather
    GROUP BY city_id
),
RankedDays AS (
    SELECT
        w.city_id,
        w.day,
        w.degree,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY w.city_id ORDER BY w.day) as row_num
    FROM Weather w
    JOIN MaxTemps m ON w.city_id = m.city_id AND w.degree = m.max_degree
)
SELECT city_id, day, degree
FROM RankedDays
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY city_id
```

Explanation: We use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to make our query more readable. First, we find the maximum temperature for each city. Then, we join this with the original table to get all records that match these maximum temperatures. We use ROW_NUMBER() to rank days within each city partition, ordering by date (earliest first). Finally, we select only the first row for each city (the earliest day with the maximum temperature).

Step 6: Final Solution with Window Function Approach

```SQL
WITH RankedTemps AS (
    SELECT
        city_id,
        day,
        degree,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city_id ORDER BY degree DESC, day) as rnk
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT city_id, day, degree
FROM RankedTemps
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY city_id
```

Explanation: This alternative solution uses a window function in a more direct way. We partition the data by city_id and rank the rows within each partition by degree in descending order (highest first), and then by day in ascending order (earliest first). This ensures that for each city, the highest temperature days are ranked first, and if there are ties, the earliest date gets the highest rank. Then we simply filter for rank = 1 to get the desired result.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedTemps AS (
    SELECT
        city_id,
        day,
        degree,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city_id ORDER BY degree DESC, day) as rnk
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT city_id, day, degree
FROM RankedTemps
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY city_id
```
