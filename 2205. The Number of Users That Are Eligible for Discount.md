**Description**

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |
| time_stamp  | datetime |
| amount      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the purchase time and the amount paid for the user with ID user_id.
```

A user is eligible for a discount if they had a purchase in the inclusive interval of time `[startDate, endDate]` with at least `minAmount` amount. To convert the dates to times, both dates should be considered as the **start** of the day (i.e., `endDate = 2022-03-05` should be considered as the time `2022-03-05 00:00:00`).

Write a solution to report the number of users that are eligible for a discount.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Purchases table:
+---------+---------------------+--------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | amount |
+---------+---------------------+--------+
| 1       | 2022-04-20 09:03:00 | 4416   |
| 2       | 2022-03-19 19:24:02 | 678    |
| 3       | 2022-03-18 12:03:09 | 4523   |
| 3       | 2022-03-30 09:43:42 | 626    |
+---------+---------------------+--------+
startDate = 2022-03-08, endDate = 2022-03-20, minAmount = 1000
Output:
+----------+
| user_cnt |
+----------+
| 1        |
+----------+
Explanation:
Out of the three users, only User 3 is eligible for a discount.
 - User 1 had one purchase with at least minAmount amount, but not within the time interval.
 - User 2 had one purchase within the time interval, but with less than minAmount amount.
 - User 3 is the only user who had a purchase that satisfies both conditions.
```

**Important Note:** This problem is basically the same as [The Users That Are Eligible for Discount](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-users-that-are-eligible-for-discount/description/).

I'll help you understand and solve this SQL problem step by step.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to count users who are eligible for a discount based on these criteria:

1. They made a purchase within a specified date range (`startDate` to `endDate` inclusive)
2. The purchase amount is at least `minAmount`

We need to count distinct users who meet both conditions.

## Step 1: Start with basic query structure

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
```

Explanation: We begin with a simple query that counts records from the Purchases table. This is our starting point.

## Step 2: Add the purchase amount filter

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
```

Explanation: We add a filter to only include purchases with an amount of at least `minAmount` (1000 in the example).

## Step 3: Add the date range filter

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp <= '2022-03-20 23:59:59'
```

Explanation: We now add a date range filter. Note that we need to be inclusive of the entire `endDate`, so we set the time to the end of the day.

## Step 4: Wait - the problem says endDate should be the start of the day

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp < '2022-03-21 00:00:00'
```

Explanation: After re-reading the problem, both dates should be considered as the start of the day. So the end date should be interpreted as "before the start of the next day" to include the entire day.

## Step 5: Count distinct users, not purchases

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp < '2022-03-21 00:00:00'
```

Explanation: We use COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) to count unique users rather than purchases, since a user might have multiple qualifying purchases.

## Step 6: Make the query parameters flexible

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= minAmount
AND time_stamp >= startDate
AND time_stamp < DATE_ADD(endDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
```

Explanation: For flexibility, we'd use parameters instead of hard-coded values. Since the problem says endDate refers to the start of the day, we need to add 1 day to include the entire last day.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_cnt
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp <= '2022-03-20 23:59:59'
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Counts distinct users who made qualifying purchases
2. Filters for purchases with an amount of at least 1000 (minAmount)
3. Filters for purchases within the specified date range
4. Returns a single value representing the count of eligible users

Note: The solution can be adapted to use parameters for startDate, endDate, and minAmount instead of hard-coded values, depending on how the query will be executed.
