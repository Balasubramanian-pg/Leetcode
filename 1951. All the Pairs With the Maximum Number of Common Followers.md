**Description**

Table: `Relations`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID follower_id is following the user with ID user_id.
```

Write a solution to find all the pairs of users with the  
maximum number of common followers. In other words, if the maximum  
number of common followers between any two users is  
`maxCommon`, then you have to return all pairs of users that have `maxCommon` common followers.

The result table should contain the pairs `user1_id` and `user2_id` where `user1_id < user2_id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Relations table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 1       | 3           |
| 2       | 3           |
| 7       | 3           |
| 1       | 4           |
| 2       | 4           |
| 7       | 4           |
| 1       | 5           |
| 2       | 6           |
| 7       | 5           |
+---------+-------------+
Output:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 7        |
+----------+----------+
Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 have two common followers (3 and 4).
Users 1 and 7 have three common followers (3, 4, and 5).
Users 2 and 7 have two common followers (3 and 4).
Since the maximum number of common followers between any two users is 3, we return all pairs of users with three common followers, which is only the pair (1, 7). We return the pair as (1, 7), not as (7, 1).
Note that we do not have any information about the users that follow users 3, 4, and 5, so we consider them to have 0 followers.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining each part clearly as we work toward finding the pairs of users with the maximum number of common followers.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Find all pairs of users and count their common followers
2. Identify the maximum count of common followers
3. Return all pairs that have this maximum count
4. Ensure user1_id < user2_id in our output

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Set up a way to find common followers

```SQL
SELECT r1.user_id AS user1_id, r2.user_id AS user2_id, r1.follower_id AS common_follower
FROM Relations r1
JOIN Relations r2 ON r1.follower_id = r2.follower_id AND r1.user_id < r2.user_id
```

Explanation: We join the Relations table with itself to find pairs of users who share the same follower. The condition r1.user_id < r2.user_id ensures we only get each pair once (with the smaller ID first).

## Step 2: Count common followers for each pair

```SQL
SELECT r1.user_id AS user1_id, r2.user_id AS user2_id, COUNT(*) AS common_followers
FROM Relations r1
JOIN Relations r2 ON r1.follower_id = r2.follower_id AND r1.user_id < r2.user_id
GROUP BY r1.user_id, r2.user_id
```

Explanation: Now we group the results by user pairs and count how many common followers each pair has. This gives us a count of common followers for each unique user pair.

## Step 3: Find pairs with the maximum count

```SQL
WITH CommonFollowers AS (
    SELECT r1.user_id AS user1_id, r2.user_id AS user2_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM Relations r1
    JOIN Relations r2 ON r1.follower_id = r2.follower_id AND r1.user_id < r2.user_id
    GROUP BY r1.user_id, r2.user_id
)
SELECT user1_id, user2_id
FROM CommonFollowers
WHERE cnt = (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM CommonFollowers)
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store the count of common followers for each pair, then filter for only those pairs that have the maximum count.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH CommonFollowers AS (
    SELECT r1.user_id AS user1_id, r2.user_id AS user2_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM Relations r1
    JOIN Relations r2 ON r1.follower_id = r2.follower_id AND r1.user_id < r2.user_id
    GROUP BY r1.user_id, r2.user_id
)
SELECT user1_id, user2_id
FROM CommonFollowers
WHERE cnt = (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM CommonFollowers)
```

This query works by:

1. Creating a CTE named CommonFollowers that:
    - Joins the Relations table with itself on follower_id
    - Ensures we only get each pair once with user1_id < user2_id
    - Groups by user pairs and counts common followers
2. Selecting only the pairs that have the maximum count of common followers
3. Returning user1_id and user2_id for these pairs

When applied to the example data, this correctly identifies that users 1 and 7 have the maximum number of common followers (3), which includes followers 3, 4, and 5.

The solution handles all the requirements:

- It finds common followers between pairs of users
- It identifies the maximum count of common followers
- It returns all pairs with this maximum count
- It ensures user1_id < user2_id in the output
