**Description**

Table: `CoffeeShop`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| drink       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table shows the order id and the name of the drink ordered. Some drink rows are nulls.
```

Write a solution to replace the `null` values of the drink with the name of the drink of the previous row that is not `null`. It is guaranteed that the drink on the first row of the table is not `null`.

Return the result table **in the same order as the input**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
CoffeeShop table:
+----+-------------------+
| id | drink             |
+----+-------------------+
| 9  | Rum and Coke      |
| 6  | null              |
| 7  | null              |
| 3  | St Germain Spritz |
| 1  | Orange Margarita  |
| 2  | null              |
+----+-------------------+
Output:
+----+-------------------+
| id | drink             |
+----+-------------------+
| 9  | Rum and Coke      |
| 6  | Rum and Coke      |
| 7  | Rum and Coke      |
| 3  | St Germain Spritz |
| 1  | Orange Margarita  |
| 2  | Orange Margarita  |
+----+-------------------+
Explanation:
For ID 6, the previous value that is not null is from ID 9. We replace the null with "Rum and Coke".
For ID 7, the previous value that is not null is from ID 9. We replace the null with "Rum and Coke;.
For ID 2, the previous value that is not null is from ID 1. We replace the null with "Orange Margarita".
Note that the rows in the output are the same as in the input.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to replace NULL values in the drink column
-- Each NULL should be replaced with the most recent non-NULL value that comes before it
-- The table should maintain its original order
-- The first row is guaranteed to have a non-NULL drink value
```

Explanation: This problem requires us to fill in missing drink values with the most recent non-NULL drink value. We need to look backward from each NULL to find the most recent non-NULL drink.

Step 2: Understanding Window Functions for This Problem

```SQL
-- We can use a window function to solve this problem
-- Specifically, LAST_VALUE() can help us get the last non-NULL value
-- We need to define a window that includes all previous rows
```

Explanation: Window functions allow us to perform calculations across a set of table rows. For this problem, we can use them to look at previous rows and find the most recent non-NULL value.

Step 3: Using LAST_VALUE with Window Function

```SQL
SELECT
    id,
    LAST_VALUE(drink IGNORE NULLS) OVER (
        ORDER BY id
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as drink
FROM CoffeeShop
```

Explanation: The LAST_VALUE function finds the last non-NULL value in the specified window. The IGNORE NULLS option tells the function to skip NULL values when looking for the last value. The window is defined to include all rows from the beginning of the result set up to the current row.

However, there's a problem with this approach. LAST_VALUE gives us the last non-NULL value in the window, but we actually want the most recent non-NULL value that comes before the current row. Since we're ordering by id, and id values are not necessarily in sequence, this might not give us the correct result.

Step 4: Using a Better Approach with COALESCE and LAG  
Let's try a different approach. First, let's add a sequential row number to the table:  

```SQL
WITH numbered_drinks AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        drink,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as row_num
    FROM CoffeeShop
)
```

Explanation: This gives us a sequential row number for each row, based on the order of id. Now we can use this row number to implement a better solution.

Step 5: Alternative Solution with Self-Join

```SQL
WITH ordered_drinks AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        drink,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as row_num
    FROM CoffeeShop
)
SELECT
    od1.id,
    COALESCE(od1.drink, od2.drink) as drink
FROM ordered_drinks od1
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        row_num,
        LAST_VALUE(drink IGNORE NULLS) OVER (
            ORDER BY row_num
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) as drink
    FROM ordered_drinks
) od2 ON od1.row_num = od2.row_num
ORDER BY od1.id
```

Explanation: This approach isn't ideal either. Let's try one more approach.

Step 6: Final Solution Using Recursive CTE

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE FilledDrinks AS (
    -- Base case: first row (which is guaranteed to be non-NULL)
    SELECT
        id,
        drink,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as row_num
    FROM CoffeeShop
    WHERE ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) = 1

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: rest of the rows
    SELECT
        c.id,
        COALESCE(c.drink, fd.drink) as drink,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY c.id) as row_num
    FROM CoffeeShop c
    JOIN FilledDrinks fd ON ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY c.id) = fd.row_num + 1
)
SELECT
    id,
    drink
FROM FilledDrinks
ORDER BY id
```

Explanation: The recursive CTE approach is complex and not well-supported in all SQL dialects.

Step 7: Solution Using Window Functions with FIRST_VALUE  
This is the most elegant solution:  

```SQL
SELECT
    id,
    FIRST_VALUE(drink IGNORE NULLS) OVER (
        ORDER BY id DESC
        ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) as drink
FROM CoffeeShop
ORDER BY id
```

Explanation: By ordering the window in descending order by id and looking from the current row to all following rows, we can use FIRST_VALUE to find the first non-NULL value, which will be the most recent non-NULL value in the original order.

However, this solution might not work correctly if the ids are not in the same order as the original table. Let's try another approach.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH ranked_drinks AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        drink,
        SUM(CASE WHEN drink IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (ORDER BY id) as grp
    FROM CoffeeShop
)
SELECT
    id,
    FIRST_VALUE(drink) OVER (PARTITION BY grp ORDER BY id) as drink
FROM ranked_drinks
ORDER BY id
```

Explanation: This solution uses a window function to create groups of rows where each group starts with a non-NULL drink value. The SUM() function creates a running count of non-NULL drink values, which increments only when a new non-NULL drink is encountered. This creates a group identifier (grp). Then we can use FIRST_VALUE() to get the first drink value within each group, which will be the non-NULL value at the start of the group. Finally, we order the results by id to maintain the original order.
