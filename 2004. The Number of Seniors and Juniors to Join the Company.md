**Description**

Table: `Candidates`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| employee_id | int  |
| experience  | enum |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
experience is an ENUM (category) type of values ('Senior', 'Junior').
Each row of this table indicates the id of a candidate, their monthly salary, and their experience.
```

A company wants to hire new employees. The budget of the company for the salaries is `$70000`. The company's criteria for hiring are:

1. Hiring the largest number of seniors.
2. After hiring the maximum number of seniors, use the remaining budget to hire the largest number of juniors.

Write a solution to find the number of seniors and juniors hired under the mentioned criteria.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 20000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 20000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 50000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output:
+------------+---------------------+
| experience | accepted_candidates |
+------------+---------------------+
| Senior     | 2                   |
| Junior     | 2                   |
+------------+---------------------+
Explanation:
We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (2, 11). Since the budget is $70000 and the sum of their salaries is $40000, we still have $30000 but they are not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is $30000 and the sum of their salaries is $20000, we still have $10000 but they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 80000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 80000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 80000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output:
+------------+---------------------+
| experience | accepted_candidates |
+------------+---------------------+
| Senior     | 0                   |
| Junior     | 3                   |
+------------+---------------------+
Explanation:
We cannot hire any seniors with the current budget as we need at least $80000 to hire one senior.
We can hire all three juniors with the remaining budget.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining the logic at each stage.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Hire the maximum number of seniors first, within a $70,000 budget
2. Use the remaining budget to hire the maximum number of juniors
3. Report the number of seniors and juniors hired

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Sort candidates by experience priority and salary

```SQL
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        -- Seniors first, then sort by salary (ascending to maximize count)
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
)
```

Explanation: First, we rank the candidates within each experience level by salary (ascending). This helps us pick the lowest-paid candidates first to maximize the number we can hire.

## Step 2: Calculate running sums for seniors

```SQL
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
),
SeniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
MaxSeniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS senior_count, COALESCE(MAX(running_total), 0) AS senior_budget
    FROM SeniorHires
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
)
```

Explanation: We calculate a running sum of salaries for seniors in increasing order. Then we count how many seniors we can hire while staying within the $70,000 budget.

## Step 3: Calculate juniors with remaining budget

```SQL
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
),
SeniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
MaxSeniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS senior_count, COALESCE(MAX(running_total), 0) AS senior_budget
    FROM SeniorHires
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
JuniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Junior'
),
MaxJuniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS junior_count
    FROM JuniorHires j, MaxSeniors s
    WHERE j.running_total <= 70000 - s.senior_budget
)
```

Explanation: Using the remaining budget (total budget - senior budget), we calculate how many juniors we can hire, again using a running sum.

## Step 4: Format the output

```SQL
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
),
SeniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
MaxSeniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS senior_count, COALESCE(MAX(running_total), 0) AS senior_budget
    FROM SeniorHires
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
JuniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Junior'
),
MaxJuniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS junior_count
    FROM JuniorHires j, MaxSeniors s
    WHERE j.running_total <= 70000 - s.senior_budget
)
SELECT 'Senior' AS experience, senior_count AS accepted_candidates FROM MaxSeniors
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Junior' AS experience, junior_count AS accepted_candidates FROM MaxJuniors
```

Explanation: Finally, we format the output to show the count of seniors and juniors hired according to the specified format.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
),
SeniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
MaxSeniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS senior_count, COALESCE(MAX(running_total), 0) AS senior_budget
    FROM SeniorHires
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
JuniorHires AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        rank_within_exp,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY rank_within_exp ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM RankedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Junior'
),
MaxJuniors AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS junior_count
    FROM JuniorHires j, MaxSeniors s
    WHERE j.running_total <= 70000 - s.senior_budget
)
SELECT 'Senior' AS experience, senior_count AS accepted_candidates FROM MaxSeniors
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Junior' AS experience, junior_count AS accepted_candidates FROM MaxJuniors
```

This solution works by:

1. Ranking candidates within each experience level by salary (ascending)
2. Calculating a running sum of senior salaries to find the maximum number of seniors we can hire
3. Determining the remaining budget after hiring seniors
4. Calculating how many juniors we can hire with the remaining budget
5. Formatting the output to show the count of both seniors and juniors hired

For Example 1, the output shows:

- 2 seniors hired (IDs 2 and 11 with salaries of $20,000 each, total $40,000)
- 2 juniors hired (IDs 1 and 9 with salaries of $10,000 each, using $20,000 of the remaining $30,000)

And for Example 2, the output shows:

- 0 seniors hired (all seniors have salaries of $80,000, exceeding the budget)
- 3 juniors hired (IDs 1, 9, and 4 with salaries totaling $60,000)
