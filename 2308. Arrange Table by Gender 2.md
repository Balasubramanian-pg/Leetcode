**Description**

Table: `Genders`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| gender      | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
gender is ENUM (category) of type 'female', 'male', or 'other'.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a user and their gender.
The table has an equal number of 'female', 'male', and 'other'.
```

Write a solution to rearrange the `Genders` table such that the rows alternate between `'female'`, `'other'`, and `'male'` in order. The table should be rearranged such that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.

Return the result table in **the mentioned order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Genders table:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 3       | female |
| 8       | male   |
| 6       | other  |
| 1       | other  |
| 9       | female |
+---------+--------+
Output:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 3       | female |
| 1       | other  |
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 9       | female |
| 6       | other  |
| 8       | male   |
+---------+--------+
Explanation:
Female gender: IDs 3, 7, and 9.
Other gender: IDs 1, 2, and 6.
Male gender: IDs 4, 5, and 8.
We arrange the table alternating between 'female', 'other', and 'male'.
Note that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.
```

**Solutions**

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
This problem asks us to rearrange the Genders table so that:  

1. Rows alternate between 'female', 'other', and 'male' in that specific order
2. Within each gender, the user_ids should be sorted in ascending order
3. The final table should follow this pattern: female, other, male, female, other, male, etc.

Step 2: Basic Approach with ROW_NUMBER()

```SQL
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        gender,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) as row_num
    FROM Genders
) ranked_data
```

Explanation: First, we need to rank each user within their gender group. The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a sequential number to each row within each gender partition, ordered by user_id. This gives us a way to match corresponding rows from each gender.

Step 3: Adding Order Priority for Genders

```SQL
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        gender,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) as row_num,
        CASE
            WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1
            WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2
            WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 3
        END as gender_order
    FROM Genders
) ranked_data
```

Explanation: We need to establish the specific order of genders (female, other, male). The CASE statement assigns a numeric value to each gender to represent its desired position in the sequence.

Step 4: Ordering the Results

```SQL
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        gender,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) as row_num,
        CASE
            WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1
            WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2
            WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 3
        END as gender_order
    FROM Genders
) ranked_data
ORDER BY row_num, gender_order
```

Explanation: We order first by row_num, which groups together the first user from each gender, then the second user from each gender, and so on. Within each of these groups, we order by gender_order to ensure the female-other-male sequence.

Step 5: Final Solution Using WITH Clause (CTE)

```SQL
WITH ranked_data AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        gender,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) as row_num,
        CASE
            WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1
            WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2
            WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 3
        END as gender_order
    FROM Genders
)
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM ranked_data
ORDER BY row_num, gender_order
```

Explanation: The final solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) for better readability. This query:

1. Ranks each user within their gender by user_id
2. Assigns an order value to each gender
3. Sorts first by the row number (to group corresponding positions)
4. Then sorts by gender order to maintain the female-other-male pattern

Final Solution Alternative Using RANK() (Like the provided solution):

```SQL
WITH t AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY gender
            ORDER BY user_id
        ) AS rk1,
        CASE
            WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 0
            WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 1
            ELSE 2
        END AS rk2
    FROM Genders
)
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM t
ORDER BY rk1, rk2;
```

Explanation: This solution is similar to our approach but uses RANK() instead of ROW_NUMBER(). RANK() would give the same values as ROW_NUMBER() in this case since user_id is unique. The main difference is in how we order the results - we sort first by the rank (rk1) and then by the gender order (rk2).

Alternative Simplified Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    gender
FROM Genders
ORDER BY
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id),
    CASE
        WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1
        WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END;
```

Explanation: This solution eliminates the need for a subquery or CTE by directly incorporating the ordering logic in the ORDER BY clause. It ranks users within their gender group and then applies the gender order directly in the ORDER BY, achieving the same alternating pattern.
