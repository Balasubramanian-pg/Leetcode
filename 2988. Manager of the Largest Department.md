**Description**

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| emp_id      | int     |
| emp_name    | varchar |
| dep_id      | int     |
| position    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
emp_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains emp_id, emp_name, dep_id, and position.
```

Write a solution to find the **name** of the **manager** from the **largest department**. There may be multiple largest departments when the number of employees in those departments is the same.

Return _the result table sorted by_ `dep_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+--------+----------+--------+---------------+
| emp_id | emp_name | dep_id | position      |
+--------+----------+--------+---------------+
| 156    | Michael  | 107    | Manager       |
| 112    | Lucas    | 107    | Consultant    |
| 8      | Isabella | 101    | Manager       |
| 160    | Joseph   | 100    | Manager       |
| 80     | Aiden    | 100    | Engineer      |
| 190    | Skylar   | 100    | Freelancer    |
| 196    | Stella   | 101    | Coordinator   |
| 167    | Audrey   | 100    | Consultant    |
| 97     | Nathan   | 101    | Supervisor    |
| 128    | Ian      | 101    | Administrator |
| 81     | Ethan    | 107    | Administrator |
+--------+----------+--------+---------------+
Output
+--------------+--------+
| manager_name | dep_id |
+--------------+--------+
| Joseph       | 100    |
| Isabella     | 101    |
+--------------+--------+
Explanation
- Departments with IDs 100 and 101 each has a total of 4 employees, while department 107 has 3 employees. Since both departments 100 and 101 have an equal number of employees, their respective managers will be included.
Output table is ordered by dep_id in ascending order.

```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the manager(s) of the department(s) with the most employees. If there's a tie for the largest department size, all managers from those largest departments should be included. The output should be the manager's name and their department ID, ordered by department ID.

We will be working with the `Employees` table. We need to find the size of each department, identify the largest size, and then find the manager in the department(s) matching that size.

Step 1: We need to determine the size of each department. We can count the employees within each department using a window function, partitioning by the department ID. This count will be associated with every employee in that department.

```SQL
WITH DepartmentSizes AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        dep_id,
        position,
        -- Calculate the total number of employees in each department
        COUNT(emp_id) OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id) AS dept_size
    FROM Employees
)
-- This CTE calculates the size of each department and includes it alongside each employee's details.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `DepartmentSizes`. We select the original employee details and add a new column `dept_size`. `COUNT(emp_id) OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id)` is a window function:

- `PARTITION BY dep_id`: This tells the `COUNT` function to perform the counting separately for each unique `dep_id`.
- `COUNT(emp_id)`: Counts the non-null `emp_id` values within each partition.  
    The result is that every row in the CTE will have the total number of employees in that row's  
    `dep_id`.

Step 2: Now that we know the size of each department, we need to find the _maximum_ department size across all departments. We can use another window function, `MAX()`, over the entire result set (no partitioning needed) or over the department sizes themselves. Alternatively, we can find the max size in a separate step. Let's rank departments by size.

```SQL
WITH DepartmentSizes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedDepartments AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        dep_id,
        position,
        dept_size,
        -- Rank the departments based on their size (dept_size), largest first
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY dept_size DESC) AS dept_rank
    FROM DepartmentSizes
)
-- This CTE ranks each department based on its size. Departments with the largest size get rank 1.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `RankedDepartments` from `DepartmentSizes`. We add a column `dept_rank` using `DENSE_RANK()`.

- `ORDER BY dept_size DESC`: This orders the rows based on the `dept_size` from largest to smallest.
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns a rank. The department(s) with the largest `dept_size` get rank 1. If multiple departments have the same largest size, they all get rank 1. The next rank assigned will be 2, and so on. Every employee row will now include the rank of their department based on size.

Step 3: We need to find the manager(s) in the department(s) that are ranked 1 (the largest departments). We filter the `RankedDepartments` CTE to keep rows where `dept_rank` is 1 AND the employee's `position` is 'Manager'.

```SQL
WITH DepartmentSizes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedDepartments AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    emp_name AS manager_name, -- Alias employee name as manager_name
    dep_id
FROM RankedDepartments
WHERE dept_rank = 1 -- Keep only employees in the largest department(s)
AND position = 'Manager'; -- And keep only the managers
-- This filters the results to find the employees who are managers in the largest departments.
```

Explanation: We select the `emp_name` (aliased as `manager_name`) and `dep_id` from the `RankedDepartments` CTE. The `WHERE` clause filters for rows where the `dept_rank` is 1 (identifying employees in the largest department(s)) AND the `position` is 'Manager'.

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the result table to be ordered by `dep_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH DepartmentSizes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedDepartments AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    emp_name AS manager_name,
    dep_id
FROM RankedDepartments
WHERE dept_rank = 1
AND position = 'Manager'
ORDER BY dep_id ASC; -- Order the final output by department ID
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY dep_id ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final results based on the department ID from smallest to largest.

This query correctly identifies the largest department size(s), finds the manager(s) within those departments, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH DepartmentSizes AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        dep_id,
        position,
        COUNT(emp_id) OVER (PARTITION BY dep_id) AS dept_size
    FROM Employees
),
RankedDepartments AS (
    SELECT
        emp_id,
        emp_name,
        dep_id,
        position,
        dept_size,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY dept_size DESC) AS dept_rank
    FROM DepartmentSizes
)
SELECT
    emp_name AS manager_name,
    dep_id
FROM RankedDepartments
WHERE dept_rank = 1
AND position = 'Manager'
ORDER BY dep_id ASC;
```
