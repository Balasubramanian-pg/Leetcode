**Description**

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
```

A company wants to divide the employees into teams such that all the members on each team have the **same salary**. The teams should follow these criteria:

- Each team should consist of **at least two** employees.
- All the employees on a team should have the **same salary**.
- All the employees of the same salary should be assigned to the same team.
- If the salary of an employee is unique, we **do not** assign this employee to any team.
- A team's ID is assigned based on the **rank of the team's salary** relative to the other teams' salaries, where the team with the **lowest** salary has `team_id = 1`. Note that the salaries for employees not on a team are **not included** in this ranking.

Write a solution to get the `team_id` of each employee that is in a team.

Return the result table ordered by `team_id` **in ascending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `employee_id` in **ascending order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3000   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7400   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
| employee_id | name    | salary | team_id |
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   | 1       |
| 3           | Michael | 3000   | 1       |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   | 2       |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7400   | 2       |
+-------------+---------+--------+---------+
Explanation:
Meir (employee_id=2) and Michael (employee_id=3) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 3000.
Addilyn (employee_id=7) and Kannon (employee_id=9) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 7400.
Juan (employee_id=8) is not included in any team because their salary of 6100 is unique (i.e. no other employee has the same salary).
The team IDs are assigned as follows (based on salary ranking, lowest first):
- team_id=1: Meir and Michael, a salary of 3000
- team_id=2: Addilyn and Kannon, a salary of 7400
Juan's salary of 6100 is not included in the ranking because they are not on a team.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Group employees into teams where all team members have the same salary
2. Teams must have at least 2 employees
3. All employees with the same salary must be in the same team
4. Employees with unique salaries are not assigned to teams
5. Team IDs are based on the rank of team salaries (lowest salary = team_id 1)
6. Return the result ordered by team_id, then employee_id

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Find salaries that appear more than once

```SQL
SELECT salary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY salary
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
```

Explanation: This query identifies salaries that appear at least twice in the Employees table. According to the problem, employees are only assigned to teams if there are at least 2 employees with the same salary.

## Step 2: Rank these qualifying salaries

```SQL
SELECT salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS team_id
FROM Employees
GROUP BY salary
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
```

Explanation: We use DENSE_RANK() to assign ranks to the qualifying salaries in ascending order. The lowest salary gets team_id = 1, the next lowest gets team_id = 2, and so on. We use DENSE_RANK() rather than RANK() to ensure there are no gaps in the team_id sequence.

## Step 3: Join with the original table to get employee details with team_id

```SQL
WITH TeamSalaries AS (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS team_id
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY salary
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
)
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.salary, t.team_id
FROM Employees e
JOIN TeamSalaries t ON e.salary = t.salary
ORDER BY t.team_id, e.employee_id
```

Explanation: We create a CTE (Common Table Expression) named TeamSalaries that contains the ranked salaries. Then we join this with the original Employees table to get the employee details along with their team_id. We order the results first by team_id and then by employee_id as required.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH TeamSalaries AS (
    SELECT salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS team_id
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY salary
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
)
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.salary, t.team_id
FROM Employees e
JOIN TeamSalaries t ON e.salary = t.salary
ORDER BY t.team_id, e.employee_id
```

This solution:

1. Identifies salaries that appear at least twice (qualifying for team formation)
2. Assigns a team_id to each qualifying salary based on its rank
3. Joins this information back with the original employee data
4. Orders the results as required

The query effectively implements all the rules from the problem statement and returns the expected output format.
