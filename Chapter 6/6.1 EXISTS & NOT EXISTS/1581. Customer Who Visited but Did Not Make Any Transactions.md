Table: `Visits`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.
```

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
transaction_id is column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.
```

Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without  
making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of  
visits.  

Return the result table sorted in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Visits
+----------+-------------+
| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
+----------------+----------+--------+
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |

| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
Explanation:
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
```

# Finding Customers Who Visited Without Making Transactions

To solve this problem, I need to identify customers who visited the mall but didn't make any transactions, and count how many such visits they had.

## Approach

1. **Left Join**: Connect Visits with Transactions to include all visits
2. **Filter Null Transactions**: Find visits with no matching transactions
3. **Count Visits per Customer**: Group by customer_id and count these non-transaction visits
4. **Exclude Customers with Transactions**: Only include customers who had at least one visit without transactions

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM
    Visits v
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions t ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE
    t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY
    v.customer_id;
```

## Explanation

1. The LEFT JOIN ensures we keep all visits, even those without transactions
2. The WHERE clause filters for visits with no matching transactions (transaction_id IS NULL)
3. GROUP BY customer_id combines all qualifying visits for each customer
4. COUNT(v.visit_id) calculates how many non-transaction visits each customer had
5. In the example:
    - Customer 54 had 2 visits without transactions (visit_ids 7 and 8)
    - Customers 30 and 96 each had 1 visit without transactions
    - Customers with only transactional visits (23 and 9) are excluded

This solution efficiently identifies customers who visited without purchasing and counts their non-transaction visits.
