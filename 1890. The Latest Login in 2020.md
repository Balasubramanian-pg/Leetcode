Table: `Logins`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the login time for the user with ID user_id.
```

Write a solution to report the **latest** login for all users in the year `2020`. Do **not** include the users who did not login in `2020`.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Logins table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 6       | 2021-04-21 14:06:06 |
| 6       | 2019-03-07 00:18:15 |
| 8       | 2020-02-01 05:10:53 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
| 2       | 2019-08-25 07:59:08 |
| 14      | 2019-07-14 09:00:00 |
| 14      | 2021-01-06 11:59:59 |
+---------+---------------------+
Output:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | last_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
+---------+---------------------+
Explanation:
User 6 logged into their account 3 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 8 logged into their account 2 times in 2020, once in February and once in December. We include only the latest one (December) in the result table.
User 2 logged into their account 2 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 14 did not login in 2020, so we do not include them in the result table.
```

# Finding Latest User Logins in 2020

To solve this problem, I need to identify the most recent login timestamp for each user in the year 2020, excluding users who didn't log in during that year.

## Approach

1. **Filter 2020 Logins**: Select only login records from 2020
2. **Find Latest Login**: For each user, get the maximum (latest) timestamp
3. **Exclude Non-2020 Users**: Only include users with logins in 2020
4. **Format Output**: Return user_id and last_stamp columns

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM
    Logins
WHERE
    YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020
GROUP BY
    user_id;
```

## Explanation

1. `WHERE YEAR(time_stamp) = 2020` filters for logins occurring in 2020
2. `GROUP BY user_id` creates groups for each user
3. `MAX(time_stamp)` finds the latest login timestamp for each user
4. The result automatically excludes users without 2020 logins
5. In the example:
    - User 6: only one 2020 login (2020-06-30)
    - User 8: two 2020 logins - latest is 2020-12-30
    - User 2: only one 2020 login (2020-01-16)
    - User 14: no 2020 logins (excluded)

This solution efficiently finds the required latest logins using aggregation and filtering by year.
