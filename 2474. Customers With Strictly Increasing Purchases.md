**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| order_id     | int  |
| customer_id  | int  |
| order_date   | date |
| price        | int  |
+--------------+------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains the id of an order, the id of customer that ordered it, the date of the order, and its price.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of the customers with the **total purchases** strictly increasing yearly.

- The **total purchases** of a customer in one year is  
    the sum of the prices of their orders in that year. If for some year the customer did not make any order, we consider the total purchases  
    `0`.
- The first year to consider for each customer is the year of their **first order**.
- The last year to consider for each customer is the year of their **last order**.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
| order_id | customer_id | order_date | price |
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
| 1        | 1           | 2019-07-01 | 1100  |
| 2        | 1           | 2019-11-01 | 1200  |
| 3        | 1           | 2020-05-26 | 3000  |
| 4        | 1           | 2021-08-31 | 3100  |
| 5        | 1           | 2022-12-07 | 4700  |
| 6        | 2           | 2015-01-01 | 700   |
| 7        | 2           | 2017-11-07 | 1000  |
| 8        | 3           | 2017-01-01 | 900   |
| 9        | 3           | 2018-11-07 | 900   |
+----------+-------------+------------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
Customer 1: The first year is 2019 and the last year is 2022
  - 2019: 1100 + 1200 = 2300
  - 2020: 3000
  - 2021: 3100
  - 2022: 4700
  We can see that the total purchases are strictly increasing yearly, so we include customer 1 in the answer.

Customer 2: The first year is 2015 and the last year is 2017
  - 2015: 700
  - 2016: 0
  - 2017: 1000
  We do not include customer 2 in the answer because the total purchases are not strictly increasing. Note that customer 2 did not make any purchases in 2016.

Customer 3: The first year is 2017, and the last year is 2018
  - 2017: 900
  - 2018: 900
 We do not include customer 3 in the answer because the total purchases are not strictly increasing.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to find customers whose total purchases are strictly increasing year by year
-- Total purchases = sum of order prices in a given year
-- If a customer made no orders in a year between their first and last order, count that as 0
-- We only consider years between a customer's first and last orders (inclusive)
```

Explanation: This problem requires us to track each customer's spending patterns over time. We need to identify customers whose yearly total purchases strictly increase from their first order year to their last order year, with no exceptions.

Step 2: Get the Total Purchases Per Customer Per Year

```SQL
SELECT
    customer_id,
    YEAR(order_date) as order_year,
    SUM(price) as total_price
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id, YEAR(order_date)
```

Explanation: First, we need to calculate how much each customer spent in each year by summing up all their order prices, grouped by customer and year.

Step 3: Find First and Last Order Year for Each Customer

```SQL
WITH customer_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(YEAR(order_date)) as first_year,
        MAX(YEAR(order_date)) as last_year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
```

Explanation: We need to determine the first and last years to consider for each customer. This CTE identifies the year of the first and last orders for each customer.

Step 4: Generate All Years Between First and Last for Each Customer

```SQL
WITH customer_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(YEAR(order_date)) as first_year,
        MAX(YEAR(order_date)) as last_year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
year_range AS (
    SELECT
        cy.customer_id,
        y.year
    FROM customer_years cy
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(order_date) as year
        FROM Orders
    ) y
    WHERE y.year BETWEEN cy.first_year AND cy.last_year
)
```

Explanation: This step is a bit complex. We need to ensure we consider all years between a customer's first and last order, including years where they made no purchases. We create a list of all possible years from the Orders table and cross join it with the customer_years CTE, filtering to keep only years within each customer's range.

Step 5: Get Complete Yearly Total Purchases with 0 for Missing Years

```SQL
WITH customer_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(YEAR(order_date)) as first_year,
        MAX(YEAR(order_date)) as last_year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        YEAR(order_date) as year,
        SUM(price) as total_price
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, YEAR(order_date)
),
all_years AS (
    SELECT
        cy.customer_id,
        y.year
    FROM customer_years cy
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT YEAR(order_date) as year
        FROM Orders
    ) y
    WHERE y.year BETWEEN cy.first_year AND cy.last_year
),
complete_yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        ay.customer_id,
        ay.year,
        COALESCE(yt.total_price, 0) as total_price
    FROM all_years ay
    LEFT JOIN yearly_totals yt ON ay.customer_id = yt.customer_id AND ay.year = yt.year
)
```

Explanation: We combine the previous CTEs to get a complete record of each customer's spending in each year between their first and last orders. The COALESCE function assigns 0 to years where a customer made no purchases.

Step 6: Check for Strictly Increasing Yearly Totals

```SQL
WITH customer_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(YEAR(order_date)) as first_year,
        MAX(YEAR(order_date)) as last_year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        YEAR(order_date) as year,
        SUM(price) as total_price
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, YEAR(order_date)
),
all_years AS (
    SELECT
        cy.customer_id,
        year
    FROM customer_years cy
    JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT y.year
        FROM (
            SELECT MIN(YEAR(order_date)) as min_year, MAX(YEAR(order_date)) as max_year
            FROM Orders
        ) yr
        CROSS JOIN (
            SELECT YEAR(order_date) as year FROM Orders
            UNION
            SELECT YEAR(order_date) + 1 FROM Orders
            UNION
            SELECT YEAR(order_date) - 1 FROM Orders
        ) y
        WHERE y.year BETWEEN yr.min_year AND yr.max_year
    ) years ON years.year BETWEEN cy.first_year AND cy.last_year
),
complete_yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        ay.customer_id,
        ay.year,
        COALESCE(yt.total_price, 0) as total_price
    FROM all_years ay
    LEFT JOIN yearly_totals yt ON ay.customer_id = yt.customer_id AND ay.year = yt.year
),
yearly_check AS (
    SELECT
        t1.customer_id,
        t1.year,
        t1.total_price,
        t2.year as next_year,
        t2.total_price as next_total_price,
        CASE WHEN t2.total_price > t1.total_price THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_increasing
    FROM complete_yearly_totals t1
    JOIN complete_yearly_totals t2 ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id AND t2.year = t1.year + 1
)
SELECT
    customer_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(is_increasing) as all_increasing
    FROM yearly_check
    GROUP BY customer_id
) check_results
WHERE all_increasing = 1
```

Explanation: This final step compares each year's total with the next year's total for each customer. We join the complete_yearly_totals table with itself, matching each year with the following year for the same customer. The is_increasing flag is set to 1 if the next year's total is greater than the current year's total, and 0 otherwise. We then check if all years for a customer have is_increasing = 1, which means their yearly totals are strictly increasing.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        YEAR(order_date) as year,
        SUM(price) as total_price
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, YEAR(order_date)
),
customer_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(year) as first_year,
        MAX(year) as last_year
    FROM yearly_totals
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
all_years AS (
    SELECT
        cy.customer_id,
        y.year
    FROM customer_years cy
    CROSS JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT year
        FROM yearly_totals
    ) y
    WHERE y.year BETWEEN cy.first_year AND cy.last_year
),
complete_yearly_totals AS (
    SELECT
        ay.customer_id,
        ay.year,
        COALESCE(yt.total_price, 0) as total_price
    FROM all_years ay
    LEFT JOIN yearly_totals yt ON ay.customer_id = yt.customer_id AND ay.year = yt.year
    ORDER BY ay.customer_id, ay.year
),
consecutive_years AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        year,
        total_price,
        LEAD(year) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY year) as next_year,
        LEAD(total_price) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY year) as next_total_price
    FROM complete_yearly_totals
)
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM consecutive_years
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN next_year IS NOT NULL AND next_total_price <= total_price THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
   AND COUNT(DISTINCT year) = MAX(year) - MIN(year) + 1
```

Explanation: This optimized solution:

1. Calculates yearly totals for each customer
2. Determines the first and last years for each customer
3. Generates all years between first and last for each customer
4. Ensures all years have a total (using 0 for years with no orders)
5. Compares each year's total with the next year's total
6. Selects only customers where all consecutive years show strictly increasing totals

The query checks two conditions:

- No instances where the next year's total is less than or equal to the current year's total
- The count of distinct years matches the expected count based on the range, ensuring all years are accounted for
