**Description**

Table: `Accounts`

```Plain
+----------------+------+
| Column Name    | Type |
+----------------+------+
| account_id     | int  |
| max_income     | int  |
+----------------+------+
account_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the maximum monthly income for one bank account.
```

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| transaction_id | int      |
| account_id     | int      |
| type           | ENUM     |
| amount         | int      |
| day            | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
transaction_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about one transaction.
type is ENUM (category) type of ('Creditor','Debtor') where 'Creditor' means the user deposited money into their account and 'Debtor' means the user withdrew money from their account.
amount is the amount of money deposited/withdrawn during the transaction.
```

A bank account is **suspicious** if the **total income** exceeds the `max_income` for this account for **two or more consecutive** months. The **total income** of an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month (i.e., transactions of the type `'Creditor'`).

Write a solution to report the IDs of all **suspicious** bank accounts.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

+----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+
Output:
+------------+
| account_id |
+------------+
| 3          |
+------------+
Explanation:
For account 3:
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 107100 + 102100 + 90900 = 300100.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 64900.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income of 21000 for two consecutive months, so we include 3 in the result table.

For account 4:
- In 5-2021, the user had an income of 49300.
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 10400.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 56300.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income in May and July, but not in June. Since the account did not exceed the max income for two consecutive months, we do not include it in the result table.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

We need to identify suspicious bank accounts where:

1. The total income (sum of 'Creditor' transactions) exceeds the max_income
2. This happens for at least two consecutive months

Let's break this down step-by-step:

## Step 1: Calculate monthly income for each account

```SQL
SELECT
    account_id,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
```

Explanation: First, we need to calculate the total deposits (income) for each account grouped by year and month. We use EXTRACT to get the year and month parts from the date, and SUM with a CASE statement to sum only 'Creditor' transactions.

## Step 2: Identify months where income exceeds max_income

```SQL
WITH monthly_income AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
)
SELECT
    m.account_id,
    m.year,
    m.month,
    m.monthly_income,
    a.max_income,
    CASE WHEN m.monthly_income > a.max_income THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS exceeds_max
FROM monthly_income m
JOIN Accounts a ON m.account_id = a.account_id
```

Explanation: We join the monthly income calculations with the Accounts table to get each account's max_income. Then we add a flag (exceeds_max) that is 1 when the monthly income exceeds the max_income, and 0 otherwise.

## Step 3: Add a sort order to identify consecutive months

```SQL
WITH monthly_income AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
),
income_check AS (
    SELECT
        m.account_id,
        m.year,
        m.month,
        m.monthly_income,
        a.max_income,
        CASE WHEN m.monthly_income > a.max_income THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS exceeds_max,
        (m.year * 12 + m.month) AS month_order
    FROM monthly_income m
    JOIN Accounts a ON m.account_id = a.account_id
)
```

Explanation: We add a month_order column that converts the year and month into a single number for chronological ordering. This helps us detect consecutive months later.

## Step 4: Use window functions to check for consecutive months

```SQL
WITH monthly_income AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
),
income_check AS (
    SELECT
        m.account_id,
        m.year,
        m.month,
        m.monthly_income,
        a.max_income,
        CASE WHEN m.monthly_income > a.max_income THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS exceeds_max,
        (m.year * 12 + m.month) AS month_order
    FROM monthly_income m
    JOIN Accounts a ON m.account_id = a.account_id
),
consecutive_check AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        month_order,
        exceeds_max,
        month_order - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id, exceeds_max ORDER BY month_order) AS grp
    FROM income_check
    WHERE exceeds_max = 1
)
```

Explanation: We create another CTE that identifies consecutive months where income exceeds max_income. The trick is to subtract the row number from the month_order - when months are consecutive, this difference will be the same.

## Step 5: Identify accounts with consecutive months of excess income

```SQL
WITH monthly_income AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
),
income_check AS (
    SELECT
        m.account_id,
        m.year,
        m.month,
        m.monthly_income,
        a.max_income,
        CASE WHEN m.monthly_income > a.max_income THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS exceeds_max,
        (m.year * 12 + m.month) AS month_order
    FROM monthly_income m
    JOIN Accounts a ON m.account_id = a.account_id
),
consecutive_check AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        month_order,
        exceeds_max,
        month_order - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id, exceeds_max ORDER BY month_order) AS grp
    FROM income_check
    WHERE exceeds_max = 1
)
SELECT DISTINCT account_id
FROM consecutive_check
GROUP BY account_id, grp
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
```

Explanation: Finally, we group by account_id and grp (which identifies consecutive sequences) and keep only those groups with at least 2 records, meaning at least 2 consecutive months where income exceeded max_income.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH monthly_income AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day) AS month,
        SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'Creditor' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS monthly_income
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY account_id, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM day), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM day)
),
income_check AS (
    SELECT
        m.account_id,
        m.year,
        m.month,
        m.monthly_income,
        a.max_income,
        CASE WHEN m.monthly_income > a.max_income THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS exceeds_max,
        (m.year * 12 + m.month) AS month_order
    FROM monthly_income m
    JOIN Accounts a ON m.account_id = a.account_id
),
consecutive_check AS (
    SELECT
        account_id,
        month_order,
        exceeds_max,
        month_order - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id, exceeds_max ORDER BY month_order) AS grp
    FROM income_check
    WHERE exceeds_max = 1
)
SELECT DISTINCT account_id
FROM consecutive_check
GROUP BY account_id, grp
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
```

This solution:

1. Calculates monthly income for each account
2. Identifies months where income exceeds the maximum allowed
3. Groups those months to find consecutive periods
4. Returns account IDs that have at least 2 consecutive months of excessive income

The window function technique with row_number() is a common pattern for identifying consecutive elements in SQL. When we subtract the row number from an ordered sequence, groups of consecutive values will have the same difference.
