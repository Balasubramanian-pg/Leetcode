**Description**

Table: `transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| amount           | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
+------------------+------+
The transactions_id column uniquely identifies each row in this table.
Each row of this table contains the transaction id, amount and transaction date.
```

Write a solution to find the **sum of amounts** for **odd** and **even** transactions for each day. If there are no odd or even transactions for a specific date, display as `0`.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `transaction_date` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`transactions` table:

```Plain
+----------------+--------+------------------+
| transaction_id | amount | transaction_date |
+----------------+--------+------------------+
| 1              | 150    | 2024-07-01       |
| 2              | 200    | 2024-07-01       |
| 3              | 75     | 2024-07-01       |
| 4              | 300    | 2024-07-02       |
| 5              | 50     | 2024-07-02       |
| 6              | 120    | 2024-07-03       |
+----------------+--------+------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+------------------+---------+----------+
| transaction_date | odd_sum | even_sum |
+------------------+---------+----------+
| 2024-07-01       | 75      | 350      |
| 2024-07-02       | 0       | 350      |
| 2024-07-03       | 0       | 120      |
+------------------+---------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For transaction dates:
    - 2024-07-01:
        - Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 75
        - Sum of amounts for even transactions: 150 + 200 = 350
    - 2024-07-02:
        - Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 0
        - Sum of amounts for even transactions: 300 + 50 = 350
    - 2024-07-03:
        - Sum of amounts for odd transactions: 0
        - Sum of amounts for even transactions: 120

**Note:** The output table is ordered by `transaction_date` in ascending order.

**Solutions**

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Group transactions by `transaction_date`.
2. Calculate the sum of amounts for **odd** and **even** transactions separately for each date.
3. If there are no odd or even transactions for a specific date, display **0**.
4. Order the result by `transaction_date` in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Use `MOD(transaction_id, 2)` to determine if a transaction is odd (`1`) or even (`0`).
- Use conditional aggregation to sum amounts for odd and even transactions.
- Ensure all dates are included in the result, even if there are no odd or even transactions.

---

### **Step 2: Group by Date and Calculate Sums**

We’ll group the transactions by `transaction_date` and calculate the sums for odd and even transactions using conditional aggregation.

```SQL
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
FROM
    transactions
GROUP BY
    transaction_date
ORDER BY
    transaction_date;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**MOD(transaction_id, 2)**`: Determines if the transaction is odd (`1`) or even (`0`).
- `**SUM(CASE ...)**`: Conditionally sums the amounts for odd and even transactions.
    - For `odd_sum`: Sums amounts where `MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 1`.
    - For `even_sum`: Sums amounts where `MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 0`.
- `**GROUP BY transaction_date**`: Groups the results by date.
- `**ORDER BY transaction_date**`: Orders the result by date in ascending order.

---

### **Step 3: Include All Dates (Even with No Transactions)**

The above query works if all dates have at least one transaction. However, to ensure all dates are included (even if there are no transactions), we need to generate a list of all unique dates first.

```SQL
WITH AllDates AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT transaction_date
    FROM transactions
),
TransactionSums AS (
    SELECT
        transaction_date,
        SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
        SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        transaction_date
)
SELECT
    ad.transaction_date,
    COALESCE(ts.odd_sum, 0) AS odd_sum,
    COALESCE(ts.even_sum, 0) AS even_sum
FROM
    AllDates ad
LEFT JOIN
    TransactionSums ts
ON
    ad.transaction_date = ts.transaction_date
ORDER BY
    ad.transaction_date;
```

**Explanation:**

1. `**AllDates**` **CTE**: Generates a list of all unique `transaction_date` values.
2. `**TransactionSums**` **CTE**: Calculates the sums for odd and even transactions, similar to the previous step.
3. `**LEFT JOIN**`: Joins `AllDates` with `TransactionSums` to ensure all dates are included.
4. `**COALESCE**`: Replaces `NULL` values (for dates with no transactions) with `0`.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH AllDates AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT transaction_date
    FROM transactions
),
TransactionSums AS (
    SELECT
        transaction_date,
        SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 1 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS odd_sum,
        SUM(CASE WHEN MOD(transaction_id, 2) = 0 THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS even_sum
    FROM
        transactions
    GROUP BY
        transaction_date
)
SELECT
    ad.transaction_date,
    COALESCE(ts.odd_sum, 0) AS odd_sum,
    COALESCE(ts.even_sum, 0) AS even_sum
FROM
    AllDates ad
LEFT JOIN
    TransactionSums ts
ON
    ad.transaction_date = ts.transaction_date
ORDER BY
    ad.transaction_date;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **AllDates**: Ensures all unique dates are included in the result.
3. **TransactionSums**: Calculates sums for odd and even transactions.
4. **LEFT JOIN**: Combines all dates with their respective sums, replacing missing values with `0`.
5. **Ordering**: Orders the result by `transaction_date` in ascending order.

This query returns the desired output, including all dates and their corresponding sums for odd and even transactions.
