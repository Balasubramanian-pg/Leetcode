**Description**

Table: `Candidates`

```Plain
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| candidate_id | int      |
| name         | varchar  |
| years_of_exp | int      |
| interview_id | int      |
+--------------+----------+
candidate_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a candidate, their number of years of experience, and their interview ID.
```

Table: `Rounds`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| interview_id | int  |
| round_id     | int  |
| score        | int  |
+--------------+------+
(interview_id, round_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the score of one round of an interview.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of the candidates who have **at least two** years of experience and the sum of the score of their interview rounds is **strictly greater than** `**15**`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+--------------+---------+--------------+--------------+
| candidate_id | name    | years_of_exp | interview_id |
+--------------+---------+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | Atticus | 1            | 101          |
| 9            | Ruben   | 6            | 104          |
| 6            | Aliza   | 10           | 109          |
| 8            | Alfredo | 0            | 107          |
+--------------+---------+--------------+--------------+
Rounds table:
+--------------+----------+-------+
| interview_id | round_id | score |
+--------------+----------+-------+
| 109          | 3        | 4     |
| 101          | 2        | 8     |
| 109          | 4        | 1     |
| 107          | 1        | 3     |
| 104          | 3        | 6     |
| 109          | 1        | 4     |
| 104          | 4        | 7     |
| 104          | 1        | 2     |
| 109          | 2        | 1     |
| 104          | 2        | 7     |
| 107          | 2        | 3     |
| 101          | 1        | 8     |
+--------------+----------+-------+
Output:
+--------------+
| candidate_id |
+--------------+
| 9            |
+--------------+
Explanation:
- Candidate 11: The total score is 16, and they have one year of experience. We do not include them in the result table because of their years of experience.
- Candidate 9: The total score is 22, and they have six years of experience. We include them in the result table.
- Candidate 6: The total score is 10, and they have ten years of experience. We do not include them in the result table because the score is not good enough.
- Candidate 8: The total score is 6, and they have zero years of experience. We do not include them in the result table because of their years of experience and the score.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining each part of the solution.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find candidates who meet two conditions:

1. Have at least two years of experience
2. The sum of their interview scores is strictly greater than 15

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Filter candidates with at least two years of experience

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id
FROM Candidates
WHERE years_of_exp >= 2
```

Explanation: This query identifies all candidates who have at least 2 years of experience, meeting our first condition.

## Step 2: Calculate the total score for each interview

```SQL
SELECT interview_id, SUM(score) AS total_score
FROM Rounds
GROUP BY interview_id
```

Explanation: This query calculates the total score for each interview by summing up the scores from all rounds of that interview.

## Step 3: Join the candidates with their interview scores

```SQL
SELECT c.candidate_id
FROM Candidates c
JOIN (
    SELECT interview_id, SUM(score) AS total_score
    FROM Rounds
    GROUP BY interview_id
) r ON c.interview_id = r.interview_id
WHERE c.years_of_exp >= 2 AND r.total_score > 15
```

Explanation: We join the candidates with the calculated total scores and filter for candidates who meet both conditions - having at least 2 years of experience and a total interview score greater than 15.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT c.candidate_id
FROM Candidates c
JOIN (
    SELECT interview_id, SUM(score) AS total_score
    FROM Rounds
    GROUP BY interview_id
) r ON c.interview_id = r.interview_id
WHERE c.years_of_exp >= 2 AND r.total_score > 15
```

This query works by:

1. Creating a subquery to calculate the total score for each interview
2. Joining the Candidates table with this subquery using the interview_id
3. Filtering for candidates with at least 2 years of experience and a total score greater than 15

For the example data, this correctly identifies candidate ID 9 as the only one meeting both conditions:

- Candidate 9 (Ruben): 6 years of experience and a total score of 22
- Candidate 11 (Atticus): Only 1 year of experience (doesn't meet first condition)
- Candidate 6 (Aliza): 10 years of experience but a total score of only 10 (doesn't meet second condition)
- Candidate 8 (Alfredo): 0 years of experience and a total score of 6 (doesn't meet either condition)
