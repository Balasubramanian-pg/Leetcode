**Description**

Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Write a solution to report the **device** that is first logged in for each player.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+-----------+
| player_id | device_id |
+-----------+-----------+
| 1         | 2         |
| 2         | 3         |
| 3         | 1         |
+-----------+-----------+
```

**Solutions**

Let's break down the solution into clear, concise steps for both approaches:

---

### **Approach 1: Subquery with** `**GROUP BY**`

**Goal**: Find the **first logged-in device** for each player by identifying their earliest login date.

### Steps:

1. **Identify the First Login Date**:
    
    - Group the `Activity` table by `player_id`.
    - For each player, calculate the **earliest login date** using `MIN(event_date)`.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id;
    ```
    
2. **Retrieve the Corresponding Device ID**:
    
    - Use the results from Step 1 to filter the original `Activity` table.
    - Match rows where both `player_id` and `event_date` align with the earliest login date.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        player_id,
        device_id
    FROM Activity
    WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (
        -- Subquery from Step 1
        SELECT
            player_id,
            MIN(event_date)
        FROM Activity
        GROUP BY player_id
    );
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `GROUP BY player_id` ensures we process each player separately.
- `MIN(event_date)` guarantees the earliest date for each player.
- The composite `(player_id, event_date)` filter ensures accuracy (since this pair is the table’s primary key).

---

### **Approach 2: Window Function (**`**RANK()**`**)**

**Goal**: Assign a rank to each login event and select the first one for each player.

### Steps:

1. **Rank Login Events by Date**:
    
    - Use `RANK()` to assign a rank to each player’s login events.
    - Partition the data by `player_id` and order by `event_date` (ascending).
    - The earliest login date for each player gets `rank = 1`.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY player_id
            ORDER BY event_date
        ) AS login_rank
    FROM Activity;
    ```
    
2. **Filter for the First Login**:
    
    - Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store the ranked results.
    - Select rows where `login_rank = 1`.
    
    ```SQL
    WITH RankedLogins AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY player_id
                ORDER BY event_date
            ) AS login_rank
        FROM Activity
    )
    SELECT
        player_id,
        device_id
    FROM RankedLogins
    WHERE login_rank = 1;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `RANK()` partitions data by `player_id`, treating each player’s data as a separate group.
- Ordering by `event_date` ensures the earliest date is ranked first.
- Filtering by `rank = 1` isolates the first login event.

### Key Differences Between Approaches

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Subquery Approach**|**Window Function Approach**|
|Uses aggregation (`GROUP BY`, `MIN()`)|Uses ranking (`RANK()`)|
|Compatible with all SQL versions|Requires SQL support for window functions (e.g., MySQL 8.0+)|
|May perform better with indexes on `(player_id, event_date)`|Efficient with large datasets due to single table scan|
|Simple and explicit|More flexible for complex queries (e.g., ties, multiple ranks)|

### Final Solutions

### Approach 1: Subquery

```SQL
SELECT
    player_id,
    device_id
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
);
```

### Approach 2: Window Function

```SQL
WITH RankedLogins AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY player_id
            ORDER BY event_date
        ) AS login_rank
    FROM Activity
)
SELECT
    player_id,
    device_id
FROM RankedLogins
WHERE login_rank = 1;
```
