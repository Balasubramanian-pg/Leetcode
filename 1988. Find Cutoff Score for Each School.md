**Description**

Table: `Schools`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| school_id   | int  |
| capacity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
school_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the capacity of some schools. The capacity is the maximum number of students the school can accept.
```

Table: `Exam`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| score         | int  |
| student_count | int  |
+---------------+------+
score is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row in this table indicates that there are student_count students that got at least score points in the exam.
The data in this table will be logically correct, meaning a row recording a higher score will have the same or smaller student_count compared to a row recording a lower score. More formally, for every two rows i and j in the table, if scorei > scorej then student_counti <= student_countj.
```

Every year, each school announces a **minimum score requirement**  
that a student needs to apply to it. The school chooses the minimum  
score requirement based on the exam results of all the students:  

1. They want to ensure that even if **every** student meeting the requirement applies, the school can accept everyone.
2. They also want to **maximize** the possible number of students that can apply.
3. They **must** use a score that is in the `Exam` table.

Write a solution to report the **minimum score requirement** for each school. If there are multiple score values satisfying the above conditions, choose the **smallest** one. If the input data is not enough to determine the score, report `-1`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Schools table:
+-----------+----------+
| school_id | capacity |
+-----------+----------+
| 11        | 151      |
| 5         | 48       |
| 9         | 9        |
| 10        | 99       |
+-----------+----------+
Exam table:
+-------+---------------+
| score | student_count |
+-------+---------------+
| 975   | 10            |
| 966   | 60            |
| 844   | 76            |
| 749   | 76            |
| 744   | 100           |
+-------+---------------+
Output:
+-----------+-------+
| school_id | score |
+-----------+-------+
| 5         | 975   |
| 9         | -1    |
| 10        | 749   |
| 11        | 744   |
+-----------+-------+
Explanation:
- School 5: The school's capacity is 48. Choosing 975 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 10 applications, which is within capacity.
- School 10: The school's capacity is 99. Choosing 844 or 749 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 76 applications, which is within capacity. We choose the smallest of them, which is 749.
- School 11: The school's capacity is 151. Choosing 744 as the min score requirement, the school will get at most 100 applications, which is within capacity.
- School 9: The data given is not enough to determine the min score requirement. Choosing 975 as the min score, the school may get 10 requests while its capacity is 9. We do not have information about higher scores, hence we report -1.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining my approach as we go.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Find the minimum score requirement for each school
2. This score must be from the Exam table
3. Every student meeting the requirement must be able to fit within the school's capacity
4. The score should maximize the number of potential students that can apply
5. If multiple scores satisfy these conditions, choose the smallest one
6. If it's impossible to determine the score, report -1

Let's build our solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Understand the relationship between scores and capacity

```SQL
SELECT
    school_id,
    capacity,
    e.score,
    e.student_count
FROM Schools s
CROSS JOIN Exam e
```

Explanation: We start by creating all possible combinations of schools and exam scores to evaluate each score against each school's capacity.

## Step 2: Filter for valid minimum score requirements

```SQL
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    e.score
FROM Schools s
CROSS JOIN Exam e
WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
```

Explanation: We filter to include only scores where the number of students at or above that score (student_count) is less than or equal to the school's capacity. This satisfies condition #1.

## Step 3: For each school, find the score that maximizes students

```SQL
WITH ValidScores AS (
    SELECT
        s.school_id,
        e.score,
        e.student_count
    FROM Schools s
    CROSS JOIN Exam e
    WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
)
SELECT
    v.school_id,
    MIN(v.score) AS score
FROM ValidScores v
JOIN (
    SELECT
        school_id,
        MAX(student_count) AS max_students
    FROM ValidScores
    GROUP BY school_id
) m ON v.school_id = m.school_id AND v.student_count = m.max_students
GROUP BY v.school_id
```

Explanation: For each school, we find the scores that allow the maximum number of students (maximizing condition #2), then choose the minimum such score (satisfying condition #5).

## Step 4: Handle schools with no valid score

```SQL
WITH ValidScores AS (
    SELECT
        s.school_id,
        e.score,
        e.student_count
    FROM Schools s
    CROSS JOIN Exam e
    WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
),
MaxStudents AS (
    SELECT
        school_id,
        MAX(student_count) AS max_students
    FROM ValidScores
    GROUP BY school_id
),
MinScores AS (
    SELECT
        v.school_id,
        MIN(v.score) AS score
    FROM ValidScores v
    JOIN MaxStudents m ON v.school_id = m.school_id AND v.student_count = m.max_students
    GROUP BY v.school_id
)
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    COALESCE(ms.score, -1) AS score
FROM Schools s
LEFT JOIN MinScores ms ON s.school_id = ms.school_id
```

Explanation: We use a LEFT JOIN to include all schools, even those without a valid minimum score, and use COALESCE to report -1 for these schools.

## Step 5: Identifying edge cases (school 9 in the example)

For school 9 with capacity 9, we need to determine whether any score is valid. The lowest student_count in the Exam table is 10, which exceeds this school's capacity. Therefore, we need to refine our understanding of the problem.

Reading the explanation for school 9, we see "We do not have information about higher scores" - which suggests that for school 9, we should report -1 because we can't determine if there's a higher score with a student_count â‰¤ 9.

Let's adjust our final solution to account for this case.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH ValidScores AS (
    SELECT
        s.school_id,
        e.score,
        e.student_count,
        CASE
            WHEN MIN(e.student_count) OVER() > s.capacity THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS potentially_invalid
    FROM Schools s
    CROSS JOIN Exam e
    WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
),
MaxStudents AS (
    SELECT
        school_id,
        MAX(student_count) AS max_students
    FROM ValidScores
    GROUP BY school_id
),
MinScores AS (
    SELECT
        v.school_id,
        MIN(v.score) AS score
    FROM ValidScores v
    JOIN MaxStudents m ON v.school_id = m.school_id AND v.student_count = m.max_students
    GROUP BY v.school_id
)
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    COALESCE(ms.score, -1) AS score
FROM Schools s
LEFT JOIN MinScores ms ON s.school_id = ms.school_id
```

Wait, this solution doesn't correctly handle the case of school 9. Let's refine it further:

```SQL
WITH PotentiallyInvalid AS (
    SELECT s.school_id
    FROM Schools s
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM Exam e WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
    )
    OR (
        SELECT MIN(student_count) FROM Exam
    ) > s.capacity
),
ValidScores AS (
    SELECT
        s.school_id,
        e.score,
        e.student_count
    FROM Schools s
    CROSS JOIN Exam e
    WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
    AND s.school_id NOT IN (SELECT school_id FROM PotentiallyInvalid)
),
MaxStudents AS (
    SELECT
        school_id,
        MAX(student_count) AS max_students
    FROM ValidScores
    GROUP BY school_id
),
MinScores AS (
    SELECT
        v.school_id,
        MIN(v.score) AS score
    FROM ValidScores v
    JOIN MaxStudents m ON v.school_id = m.school_id AND v.student_count = m.max_students
    GROUP BY v.school_id
)
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    COALESCE(ms.score, -1) AS score
FROM Schools s
LEFT JOIN MinScores ms ON s.school_id = ms.school_id
```

After careful analysis, I need to simplify and correct my approach:

```SQL
WITH ValidScores AS (
    SELECT
        s.school_id,
        e.score,
        e.student_count,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.school_id ORDER BY e.student_count DESC, e.score) AS rn
    FROM Schools s
    CROSS JOIN Exam e
    WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
)
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    COALESCE((
        SELECT score
        FROM ValidScores
        WHERE school_id = s.school_id AND rn = 1
    ), -1) AS score
FROM Schools s
```

Let me simplify this one more time to create the most accurate solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    s.school_id,
    IFNULL((
        SELECT e.score
        FROM Exam e
        WHERE e.student_count <= s.capacity
        ORDER BY e.student_count DESC, e.score
        LIMIT 1
    ), -1) AS score
FROM Schools s
```

This final solution:

1. For each school, finds all exam scores where the student count is less than or equal to the capacity
2. Orders these scores by student_count in descending order to maximize the number of students
3. For scores with the same student_count, orders by score in ascending order to choose the smallest valid score
4. Takes the first result (or returns -1 if no valid scores exist)

This correctly handles all cases including school 9, which has no valid score requirement since the minimum student_count in the exam table (10) exceeds its capacity (9).
