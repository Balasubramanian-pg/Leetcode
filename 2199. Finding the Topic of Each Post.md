**Description**

Table: `Keywords`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| topic_id    | int     |
| word        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(topic_id, word) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a topic and a word that is used to express this topic.
There may be more than one word to express the same topic and one word may be used to express multiple topics.
```

Table: `Posts`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| post_id     | int     |
| content     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a post and its content.
Content will consist only of English letters and spaces.
```

Leetcode has collected some posts from its social media  
website and is interested in finding the topics of each post. Each topic  
can be expressed by one or more keywords. If a keyword of a certain  
topic exists in the content of a post (**case insensitive**) then the post has this topic.

Write a solution to find the topics of each post according to the following rules:

- If the post does not have keywords from any topic, its topic should be `"Ambiguous!"`.
- If the post has at least one keyword of any topic, its topic should be a string of the IDs of its topics sorted in ascending order and  
    separated by commas  
    `','`. The string should not contain duplicate IDs.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Keywords table:
+----------+----------+
| topic_id | word     |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | handball |
| 1        | football |
| 3        | WAR      |
| 2        | Vaccine  |
+----------+----------+
Posts table:
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| post_id | content                                                                |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1       | We call it soccer They call it football hahaha                         |
| 2       | Americans prefer basketball while Europeans love handball and football |
| 3       | stop the war and play handball                                         |
| 4       | warning I planted some flowers this morning and then got vaccinated    |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Output:
+---------+------------+
| post_id | topic      |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 1          |
| 2       | 1          |
| 3       | 1,3        |
| 4       | Ambiguous! |
+---------+------------+
Explanation:
1: "We call it soccer They call it football hahaha"
"football" expresses topic 1. There is no other word that expresses any other topic.

2: "Americans prefer basketball while Europeans love handball and football"
"handball" expresses topic 1. "football" expresses topic 1.
There is no other word that expresses any other topic.

3: "stop the war and play handball"
"war" expresses topic 3. "handball" expresses topic 1.
There is no other word that expresses any other topic.

4: "warning I planted some flowers this morning and then got vaccinated"
There is no word in this sentence that expresses any topic. Note that "warning" is different from "war" although they have a common prefix.
This post is ambiguous.

Note that it is okay to have one word that expresses more than one topic.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you. Let's break down what we need to do.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find topics of posts based on keywords that appear in the post content. We have two tables:

1. `Keywords` table with topic IDs and words related to those topics
2. `Posts` table with post IDs and content

We need to check if any keywords from the `Keywords` table appear in the content of the `Posts` table. The case doesn't matter (case insensitive). Then we need to return each post with its topics:

- If no keywords match, return "Ambiguous!"
- If keywords match, return a comma-separated list of distinct topic IDs in ascending order

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Start with basic query structure

```SQL
SELECT post_id
FROM Posts
```

Explanation: We begin with a simple query that selects the post IDs from the Posts table. This is our starting point.

## Step 2: Join the Keywords table

```SQL
SELECT Posts.post_id, Keywords.topic_id
FROM Posts
LEFT JOIN Keywords ON LOWER(Posts.content) LIKE CONCAT('% ', LOWER(Keywords.word), ' %')
```

Explanation: We need to join the Posts table with the Keywords table to find matches between post content and keywords. The LEFT JOIN ensures we keep all posts, even those without matching keywords. We use LOWER() to make the comparison case-insensitive and CONCAT with spaces to ensure we're matching whole words.

## Step 3: Fix the word matching to handle edge cases

```SQL
SELECT Posts.post_id, Keywords.topic_id
FROM Posts
LEFT JOIN Keywords ON
    LOWER(CONCAT(' ', Posts.content, ' ')) LIKE CONCAT('% ', LOWER(Keywords.word), ' %')
```

Explanation: Our previous approach might miss words at the beginning or end of the content. By adding spaces before and after the content, we ensure that all occurrences are caught correctly.

## Step 4: Group the results by post_id

```SQL
SELECT
    Posts.post_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT Keywords.topic_id ORDER BY Keywords.topic_id) AS topic
FROM Posts
LEFT JOIN Keywords ON
    LOWER(CONCAT(' ', Posts.content, ' ')) LIKE CONCAT('% ', LOWER(Keywords.word), ' %')
GROUP BY Posts.post_id
```

Explanation: We use GROUP_CONCAT to combine all matching topic IDs for each post. The DISTINCT keyword ensures we don't have duplicate topic IDs, and ORDER BY sorts them in ascending order.

## Step 5: Handle the "Ambiguous!" case

```SQL
SELECT
    Posts.post_id,
    CASE
        WHEN GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT Keywords.topic_id ORDER BY Keywords.topic_id) IS NULL THEN 'Ambiguous!'
        ELSE GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT Keywords.topic_id ORDER BY Keywords.topic_id)
    END AS topic
FROM Posts
LEFT JOIN Keywords ON
    LOWER(CONCAT(' ', Posts.content, ' ')) LIKE CONCAT('% ', LOWER(Keywords.word), ' %')
GROUP BY Posts.post_id
```

Explanation: We use a CASE statement to check if there are any matching topics. If there are none (NULL result from GROUP_CONCAT), we return "Ambiguous!".

## Step 6: The LIKE operator with % might be too generous. Let's ensure exact word matching

```SQL
SELECT
    p.post_id,
    IFNULL(GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT k.topic_id ORDER BY k.topic_id), 'Ambiguous!') AS topic
FROM Posts p
LEFT JOIN Keywords k ON
    INSTR(CONCAT(' ', LOWER(p.content), ' '), CONCAT(' ', LOWER(k.word), ' ')) > 0
GROUP BY p.post_id
```

Explanation: The LIKE operator with % might match partial words. Instead, we use INSTR to find exact word matches by adding spaces around both the content and the keyword. IFNULL is a more concise way to handle the "Ambiguous!" case.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    p.post_id,
    IFNULL(GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT k.topic_id ORDER BY k.topic_id), 'Ambiguous!') AS topic
FROM
    Posts p
    LEFT JOIN Keywords k ON
        INSTR(CONCAT(' ', LOWER(p.content), ' '), CONCAT(' ', LOWER(k.word), ' ')) > 0
GROUP BY p.post_id;
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Selects all posts with their IDs
2. Performs a LEFT JOIN with the Keywords table using INSTR to find exact word matches (case-insensitive)
3. Groups the results by post_id
4. Uses GROUP_CONCAT to combine all matching topic IDs (sorted and distinct)
5. Uses IFNULL to return "Ambiguous!" when no topics match

The final solution is highly efficient and handles all the specified requirements including case insensitivity, whole-word matching, and proper formatting of the topic list.
