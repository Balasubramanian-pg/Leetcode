**Description**

Table: `Subscriptions`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| start_date  | date |
| end_date    | date |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the start and end dates of an account's subscription.
Note that always start_date < end_date.
```

Table: `Streams`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| session_id  | int  |
| account_id  | int  |
| stream_date | date |
+-------------+------+
session_id is the primary key column for this table.
account_id is a foreign key from the Subscriptions table.
Each row of this table contains information about the account and the date associated with a stream session.
```

Write an SQL query to report the number of accounts that bought a subscription in `2021` but did not have any stream session.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Subscriptions table:
+------------+------------+------------+
| account_id | start_date | end_date   |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 9          | 2020-02-18 | 2021-10-30 |
| 3          | 2021-09-21 | 2021-11-13 |
| 11         | 2020-02-28 | 2020-08-18 |
| 13         | 2021-04-20 | 2021-09-22 |
| 4          | 2020-10-26 | 2021-05-08 |
| 5          | 2020-09-11 | 2021-01-17 |
+------------+------------+------------+
Streams table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| session_id | account_id | stream_date |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 14         | 9          | 2020-05-16  |
| 16         | 3          | 2021-10-27  |
| 18         | 11         | 2020-04-29  |
| 17         | 13         | 2021-08-08  |
| 19         | 4          | 2020-12-31  |
| 13         | 5          | 2021-01-05  |
+------------+------------+-------------+
Output:
+----------------+
| accounts_count |
+----------------+
| 2              |
+----------------+
Explanation: Users 4 and 9 did not stream in 2021.
User 11 did not subscribe in 2021.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining the logic at each stage.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find the number of accounts that:

1. Bought a subscription in 2021 (subscription started in 2021)
2. Did not have any stream session in 2021

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Identify accounts with subscriptions that started in 2021

```SQL
SELECT account_id
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021
```

Explanation: This query identifies all accounts whose subscriptions started in 2021, which is the first condition we need to satisfy.

## Step 2: Identify accounts with streams in 2021

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT account_id
FROM Streams
WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = 2021
```

Explanation: This query finds all accounts that had at least one stream session in 2021. We'll need to exclude these accounts from our final result.

## Step 3: Combine the conditions to find accounts that meet our criteria

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021
  AND account_id NOT IN (
    SELECT account_id
    FROM Streams
    WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = 2021
  )
```

Explanation: This query counts the number of accounts that started a subscription in 2021 but did not have any stream sessions in 2021.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021
  AND account_id NOT IN (
    SELECT account_id
    FROM Streams
    WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = 2021
  )
```

This solution works by:

1. Finding all accounts with subscriptions that started in 2021
2. Excluding accounts that had at least one stream in 2021
3. Counting the remaining accounts

For the example data:

- Accounts with subscriptions that started in 2021: 3 and 13
- Accounts with streams in 2021: 3, 5, and 13
- Accounts that meet both conditions (subscription started in 2021 AND no streams in 2021): none

Wait, that doesn't match the expected output. Let me recheck the problem description...

It looks like the problem is asking for accounts that "bought a subscription in 2021" - this means the subscription was active in 2021, not necessarily that it started in 2021. Let me correct my approach:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE YEAR(start_date) = 2021 OR YEAR(end_date) = 2021 OR (start_date < '2021-01-01' AND end_date > '2021-12-31')
  AND account_id NOT IN (
    SELECT account_id
    FROM Streams
    WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = 2021
  )
```

Actually, no. Upon rereading, I think the problem does mean subscriptions that started in 2021. Let me analyze the example more carefully:

From the example:

- Accounts 3 and 13 started subscriptions in 2021
- Accounts 3, 5, and 13 had streams in 2021
- Accounts 4 and 9 did not have streams in 2021, but they had active subscriptions in 2021
- Account 11 did not have a subscription in 2021

So the answer should include accounts that had subscriptions active in 2021 but no streams in 2021. Let me revise:

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Subscriptions
WHERE start_date <= '2021-12-31' AND end_date >= '2021-01-01'
  AND account_id NOT IN (
    SELECT account_id
    FROM Streams
    WHERE YEAR(stream_date) = 2021
  )
```

This revised solution correctly identifies accounts that had active subscriptions during any part of 2021 but did not have any stream sessions in 2021.

Based on the example data and explanation, accounts 4 and 9 meet these criteria, resulting in an accounts_count of 2.
