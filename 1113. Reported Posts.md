**Description**

Table: `Actions`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM (category) type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action, such as a reason for the report or a type of reaction.
extra is never NULL.
```

Write a solution to report the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is `2019-07-05`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
Output:
+---------------+--------------+
| report_reason | report_count |
+---------------+--------------+
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |
+---------------+--------------+
Explanation: Note that we only care about report reasons with non-zero number of reports.
```

**Solutions**

# SQL Problem: Report Reason Analysis

Let me walk you through solving this SQL problem with a structured, methodical approach.

## 1. Understanding the Problem Statement

We need to:

1. Count the number of posts reported **yesterday** (2019-07-04, since today is 2019-07-05)
2. Group these reports by their reason (stored in the `extra` column)
3. Return the report reason and count

A key insight is that we need to count **distinct posts** with reports, not the total number of reports. This is an important distinction that affects our solution.

## 2. Data Analysis and Understanding

Let's first understand what our data looks like for reported posts on 2019-07-04:

```Plain
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
```

Looking at this subset:

- Post 4 was reported twice as "spam" (by users 2 and 3)
- Post 2 was reported once as "racism" (by user 5)
- Post 5 was reported once as "racism" (by user 5)

An important observation: The example output says we should count **distinct post_id** values, not the raw number of reports. This means post 4 should only be counted once even though it was reported twice.

## 3. Initial Solution Attempt

Let's start with a straightforward approach:

```SQL
SELECT
    extra AS report_reason,
    COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS report_count
FROM Actions
WHERE action_date = '2019-07-04' AND action = 'report'
GROUP BY extra;
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Filter the data**:
    - We only care about rows where `action_date = '2019-07-04'`
    - We only care about rows where `action = 'report'`
2. **Group by reason**:
    - The `extra` column contains our report reasons
3. **Count distinct posts**:
    - `COUNT(DISTINCT post_id)` ensures we don't count the same post multiple times
4. **Return results**:
    - Rename `extra` to `report_reason` for clarity
    - Use `report_count` as specified in the expected output

## 4. Validating Against Example Data

Let's trace through the execution with our example data:

After applying our WHERE clause filters, we have these rows:

```Plain
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
```

When we group by `extra` and count distinct `post_id` values:

- For `spam`:
    - Distinct post_ids: 4
    - Count: 1
- For `racism`:
    - Distinct post_ids: 2, 5
    - Count: 2

This matches the expected output:

```Plain
+---------------+--------------+
| report_reason | report_count |
+---------------+--------------+
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |
+---------------+--------------+
```

## 5. Alternative Solutions and Optimizations

### Option 1: Using DATE_SUB() for relative date referencing

Instead of hardcoding the date, we could use a function to calculate "yesterday":

```SQL
SELECT
    extra AS report_reason,
    COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS report_count
FROM Actions
WHERE action_date = DATE_SUB('2019-07-05', INTERVAL 1 DAY)
  AND action = 'report'
GROUP BY extra;
```

This makes the query more robust if we need to run it on different days.

### Option 2: Using HAVING to filter out zero counts

While not necessary for this example, we might want to explicitly filter out reasons with zero reports:

```SQL
SELECT
    extra AS report_reason,
    COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS report_count
FROM Actions
WHERE action_date = '2019-07-04' AND action = 'report'
GROUP BY extra
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) > 0;
```

### Option 3: WITH clause for improved readability

For more complex scenarios, we could use a CTE to make the query more readable:

```SQL
WITH YesterdayReports AS (
    SELECT
        post_id,
        extra AS reason
    FROM Actions
    WHERE action_date = '2019-07-04'
      AND action = 'report'
)
SELECT
    reason AS report_reason,
    COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS report_count
FROM YesterdayReports
GROUP BY reason;
```

## 6. Index Considerations

For optimal performance, this query would benefit from the following indexes:

1. An index on `(action_date, action)` to efficiently filter reports from yesterday
2. Potentially an index including `extra` for faster grouping: `(action_date, action, extra)`

## 7. Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases our solution should handle:

1. **No reports on yesterday**: The query would return an empty result set, which is correct.
2. **Many report reasons**: The solution scales to handle any number of unique report reasons.
3. **Same post reported for multiple reasons**: Our query correctly counts each reason separately.
4. **NULL values in extra**: The problem states that extra is never NULL, but our solution would handle NULLs by grouping them separately.

## 8. Final Optimal Solution

After considering all factors, here's the optimal solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    extra AS report_reason,
    COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS report_count
FROM Actions
WHERE action_date = '2019-07-04' AND action = 'report'
GROUP BY extra;
```

This solution is:

- Clear and concise
- Correctly handles the distinct post count requirement
- Efficiently filters only the data we need
- Matches the expected output format

The query reads naturally: "Select the report reason and count of distinct posts from Actions where the action date is yesterday and the action is 'report', grouped by reason."
