**Description**

Table: `Visits`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, visit_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has visited the bank in visit_date.
```

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| user_id          | int     |
| transaction_date | date    |
| amount           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicates rows.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has done a transaction of amount in transaction_date.
It is guaranteed that the user has visited the bank in the transaction_date.(i.e The Visits table contains (user_id, transaction_date) in one row)
```

A bank wants to draw a chart of the number of transactions  
bank visitors did in one visit to the bank and the corresponding number  
of visitors who have done this number of transaction in one visit.  

Write a solutionÂ to find how many users visited the bank  
and didn't do any transactions, how many visited the bank and did one  
transaction, and so on.  

The result table will contain two columns:

- `transactions_count` which is the number of transactions done in one visit.
- `visits_count` which is the corresponding number of users who did `transactions_count` in one visit to the bank.

`transactions_count` should take all values from `0` to `max(transactions_count)` done by one or more users.

Return the result table ordered by `transactions_count`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation: The chart drawn for this example is shown above.
* For transactions_count = 0, The visits (1, "2020-01-01"), (2, "2020-01-02"), (12, "2020-01-01") and (19, "2020-01-03") did no transactions so visits_count = 4.
* For transactions_count = 1, The visits (2, "2020-01-03"), (7, "2020-01-11"), (8, "2020-01-28"), (1, "2020-01-02") and (1, "2020-01-04") did one transaction so visits_count = 5.
* For transactions_count = 2, No customers visited the bank and did two transactions so visits_count = 0.
* For transactions_count = 3, The visit (9, "2020-01-25") did three transactions so visits_count = 1.
* For transactions_count >= 4, No customers visited the bank and did more than three transactions so we will stop at transactions_count = 3
```

I'll analyze this complex SQL problem involving bank transactions and visits, explaining the solution step by step.

## Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to:

1. Count the number of transactions done per visit to the bank
2. Count how many visitors fall into each transaction count category
3. Include all transaction counts from 0 up to the maximum
4. Order the results by transaction count

## Solution Analysis

The solution uses a recursive Common Table Expression (CTE) approach with several steps:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE
    S AS (
        SELECT 0 AS n
        UNION
        SELECT n + 1
        FROM S
        WHERE
            n < (
                SELECT MAX(cnt)
                FROM
                    (
                        SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt
                        FROM Transactions
                        GROUP BY user_id, transaction_date
                    ) AS t
            )
    ),
    T AS (
        SELECT v.user_id, visit_date, IFNULL(cnt, 0) AS cnt
        FROM
            Visits AS v
            LEFT JOIN (
                SELECT user_id, transaction_date, COUNT(1) AS cnt
                FROM Transactions
                GROUP BY 1, 2
            ) AS t
                ON v.user_id = t.user_id AND v.visit_date = t.transaction_date
    )
SELECT n AS transactions_count, COUNT(user_id) AS visits_count
FROM
    S AS s
    LEFT JOIN T AS t ON s.n = t.cnt
GROUP BY n
ORDER BY n;
```

### Step 1: Creating a Sequence of Numbers

The first CTE (`S`) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 up to the maximum transaction count:

```SQL
S AS (
    SELECT 0 AS n
    UNION
    SELECT n + 1
    FROM S
    WHERE
        n < (
            SELECT MAX(cnt)
            FROM
                (
                    SELECT COUNT(1) AS cnt
                    FROM Transactions
                    GROUP BY user_id, transaction_date
                ) AS t
        )
)
```

Key points:

- It starts with 0 (to include visits with no transactions)
- The recursive part increments n by 1 each time
- The recursion stops when n reaches the maximum transaction count
- The maximum is determined by counting transactions per (user_id, transaction_date) pair

### Step 2: Counting Transactions per Visit

The second CTE (`T`) counts transactions for each visit:

```SQL
T AS (
    SELECT v.user_id, visit_date, IFNULL(cnt, 0) AS cnt
    FROM
        Visits AS v
        LEFT JOIN (
            SELECT user_id, transaction_date, COUNT(1) AS cnt
            FROM Transactions
            GROUP BY 1, 2
        ) AS t
            ON v.user_id = t.user_id AND v.visit_date = t.transaction_date
)
```

Key points:

- Creates a subquery that counts transactions for each (user_id, transaction_date)
- Uses LEFT JOIN to include all visits, even those without transactions
- `IFNULL(cnt, 0)` converts NULL values (for visits with no transactions) to 0

### Step 3: Generating the Final Result

The main query combines the previous CTEs:

```SQL
SELECT n AS transactions_count, COUNT(user_id) AS visits_count
FROM
    S AS s
    LEFT JOIN T AS t ON s.n = t.cnt
GROUP BY n
ORDER BY n;
```

Key points:

- LEFT JOIN matches transaction counts (n) with visits having that count
- GROUP BY n aggregates to count visitors for each transaction count
- Even transaction counts with zero visitors will appear in the result because of the LEFT JOIN

## Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through part of the example data:

First, the recursive CTE generates:

```Plain
S: [0, 1, 2, 3]  (since max transaction count is 3)
```

For the T CTE, some examples:

- Visit (1, 2020-01-01): No transactions, so cnt = 0
- Visit (9, 2020-01-25): 3 transactions, so cnt = 3
- Visit (1, 2020-01-02): 1 transaction, so cnt = 1

The final result groups and counts:

- transactions_count = 0: 4 visits
- transactions_count = 1: 5 visits
- transactions_count = 2: 0 visits (still included because of the recursive CTE)
- transactions_count = 3: 1 visit

## SQL Features Explained

1. **RECURSIVE CTE**: Creates a sequence of numbers without needing a separate sequence table
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Ensures all transaction counts appear in the results, even if no visits match
3. **GROUP BY 1, 2**: Shorthand for grouping by the 1st and 2nd columns in the SELECT list
4. **IFNULL()**: Handles NULL values for visits without transactions

This solution demonstrates advanced SQL techniques for generating a complete sequence of values and joining them with aggregated data to fulfill the reporting requirements.
