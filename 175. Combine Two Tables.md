**Description**

There are two tables, Person & Address

Table: `Person`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
```

Table: `Address`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
addressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
```

Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the `Person` table. If the address of a `personId` is not present in the `Address` table, report `null` instead.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Person table:
+----------+----------+-----------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
+----------+----------+-----------+
Address table:
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
Output:
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
Explanation:
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: LEFT JOIN**

We can use a left join to join the `Person` table with the `Address` table on the condition `Person.personId = Address.personId`, which will give us the first name, last name, city, and state of each person. If the address of a `personId` is not in the `Address` table, it will be reported as `null`.

- **Python**
    
    ```Python
    import pandas as pd
    def combine_two_tables(person: pd.DataFrame, address: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return pd.merge(left=person, right=address, how="left", on="personId")[
            ["firstName", "lastName", "city", "state"]
        ]
    ```
    
      
    

# SQL Solution

To solve this problem, I'll write a SQL query that joins the `Person` table with the `Address` table, ensuring that all persons are included in the result even if they don't have an address (using a LEFT JOIN).

Here's the solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    p.firstName,
    p.lastName,
    a.city,
    a.state
FROM
    Person p
LEFT JOIN
    Address a ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

## Explanation:

1. We're selecting the `firstName` and `lastName` from the `Person` table, and `city` and `state` from the `Address` table.
2. We use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure all records from the `Person` table are included in the result, even if there's no matching record in the `Address` table.
3. The join condition `ON p.personId = a.personId` matches each person with their address information.
4. For persons without an address (like personId 1 in the example), the `city` and `state` columns will automatically be NULL in the result.

This query will return exactly the output shown in the example, with all persons listed and their address information if available, or NULL values if not.
