+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates rows.
Each row of this table indicates the start day and end day of an event and the hall in which the event is held.
```

Write a solution to merge all the overlapping events that are held **in the same hall**. Two events overlap if they have **at least one day** in common.

Return the result table **in any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation: There are three halls.
Hall 1:
- The two events ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-14"] and ["2023-01-14", "2023-01-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2023-01-13", "2023-01-17"].
- The event ["2023-01-18", "2023-01-25"] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.
Hall 2:
- The two events ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"] and ["2022-12-13", "2022-12-17"] overlap. We merge them in one event ["2022-12-09", "2022-12-23"].
Hall 3:
- The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.
```

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to combine events that overlap for the same hall into a single, longer event spanning from the earliest start day to the latest end day of the overlapping events.

We have the `HallEvents` table with `hall_id`, `start_day`, and `end_day`. Overlapping means sharing at least one day. For example, [Jan 13, Jan 14] and [Jan 14, Jan 17] overlap because they share Jan 14. They should be merged into [Jan 13, Jan 17].

This is a common problem involving merging intervals. We can solve it using window functions to identify groups of overlapping events within each hall.

Step 1: We first need to look at the events for each hall separately and have them in a predictable order, specifically by their start date. This helps us process them sequentially. We'll use a Common Table Expression (CTE), which is like a temporary named result set, to do this.

```SQL
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day
    FROM HallEvents
    ORDER BY hall_id, start_day
)
-- This CTE just orders the events within each hall by their start day.
-- We'll build upon this in the next steps.
```

Explanation: We create a temporary result called `OrderedEvents`. Inside it, we simply select all columns from the `HallEvents` table and sort the rows first by `hall_id` and then by `start_day`. Sorting is crucial for the next steps where we look at previous rows.

Step 2: Now, we need to identify where a new merged interval _starts_ within each hall's sorted events. A new merged interval starts if the current event's `start_day` is _after_ the end day of the latest event _that has already been included in the current potential merged interval_. A way to track this is by looking at the maximum `end_day` of all events _before_ the current one in our sorted list for that hall. If the current event's start day is _later_ than this maximum previous end day, it means there's a gap, and this event starts a new merged block.

We'll add this logic in another CTE, building upon `OrderedEvents`.

```SQL
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day
    FROM HallEvents
    ORDER BY hall_id, start_day
),
EventGroups AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        -- Calculate the maximum end_day seen so far in this hall, considering only previous rows
        MAX(end_day) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS max_prev_end
    FROM OrderedEvents
)
-- The EventGroups CTE now includes the max_prev_end for each row.
-- We're getting closer to grouping the overlapping intervals.
```

Explanation: We introduce a second CTE called `EventGroups`. We select the hall, start, and end days from the `OrderedEvents` CTE. We also add a new column, `max_prev_end`. This column is calculated using a window function: `MAX(end_day) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING)`.

- `PARTITION BY hall_id`: This means the calculation restarts for each different `hall_id`.
- `ORDER BY start_day`: This specifies the order within each partition.
- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING`: This is the window frame. It tells the function to look at all rows from the very beginning (`UNBOUNDED PRECEDING`) of the partition up to the row _just before_ the current row (`1 PRECEDING`).  
    So,  
    `max_prev_end` for a row is the latest end day among all events in the same hall that appeared _before_ it when sorted by `start_day`. For the very first event in a hall, `max_prev_end` will be `NULL`.

Step 3: Now that we can see the maximum previous end day, we can identify where a new merged group begins. A new group starts if the current event's `start_day` is greater than the `max_prev_end` (or if `max_prev_end` is NULL, which happens for the first event in a hall). We can assign a group number by counting these "new group starts" cumulatively.

```SQL
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day
    FROM HallEvents
    ORDER BY hall_id, start_day
),
EventGroups AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        MAX(end_day) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS max_prev_end
    FROM OrderedEvents
),
GroupedIntervals AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        -- Assign a group ID: a cumulative sum of the 'is_new_group' flag
        SUM(CASE
                -- A new group starts if current event starts after the max end of previous events
                WHEN start_day > max_prev_end OR max_prev_end IS NULL THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day) AS group_id
    FROM EventGroups
)
-- The GroupedIntervals CTE now has a group_id for each event.
-- All events within the same hall and group_id belong to the same merged interval.
```

Explanation: We add a third CTE called `GroupedIntervals`. We select columns from `EventGroups`. We introduce `group_id`.

- We use a `CASE` statement: `WHEN start_day > max_prev_end OR max_prev_end IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`. This assigns `1` if the current event starts a new group (either because its start day is after the previous max end, or it's the first event), and `0` otherwise.
- We then use `SUM(...) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day)`: This is a cumulative sum. It adds up the `1`s and `0`s within each `hall_id`, ordered by `start_day`. Every time a new group "starts" (where the `CASE` statement returns 1), the cumulative sum increases, giving a new, unique `group_id` for that merged block of events within that hall.

Step 4: Finally, now that we have events grouped correctly by `hall_id` and `group_id`, we can aggregate them. For each group, the merged interval starts at the minimum `start_day` and ends at the maximum `end_day` of all events in that group.

```SQL
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day
    FROM HallEvents
    ORDER BY hall_id, start_day
),
EventGroups AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        MAX(end_day) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS max_prev_end
    FROM OrderedEvents
),
GroupedIntervals AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        SUM(CASE
                WHEN start_day > max_prev_end OR max_prev_end IS NULL THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day) AS group_id
    FROM EventGroups
)
SELECT
    hall_id,
    MIN(start_day) AS start_day,
    MAX(end_day) AS end_day
FROM GroupedIntervals
GROUP BY hall_id, group_id;
```

Explanation: We select the `hall_id`, the minimum `start_day`, and the maximum `end_day` from the `GroupedIntervals` CTE. We use `GROUP BY hall_id, group_id` to process each distinct group of overlapping events in each hall. `MIN(start_day)` finds the earliest start date in the group, and `MAX(end_day)` finds the latest end date, giving us the merged interval.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day
    FROM HallEvents
    ORDER BY hall_id, start_day
),
EventGroups AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        MAX(end_day) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING) AS max_prev_end
    FROM OrderedEvents
),
GroupedIntervals AS (
    SELECT
        hall_id,
        start_day,
        end_day,
        SUM(CASE
                WHEN start_day > max_prev_end OR max_prev_end IS NULL THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END) OVER (PARTITION BY hall_id ORDER BY start_day) AS group_id
    FROM EventGroups
)
SELECT
    hall_id,
    MIN(start_day) AS start_day,
    MAX(end_day) AS end_day
FROM GroupedIntervals
GROUP BY hall_id, group_id;
