**Description**

Table: `Tree`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| N           | int  |
| P           | int  |
+-------------+------+
N is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row includes N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
```

Write a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:

- **Root**: if the node is the root node.
- **Leaf**: if the node is the leaf node.
- **Inner**: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.

Return _the result table ordered by node value in **ascending order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Tree table:
+---+------+
| N | P    |
+---+------+
| 1 | 2    |
| 3 | 2    |
| 6 | 8    |
| 9 | 8    |
| 2 | 5    |
| 8 | 5    |
| 5 | null |
+---+------+
Output:
+---+-------+
| N | Type  |
+---+-------+
| 1 | Leaf  |
| 2 | Inner |
| 3 | Leaf  |
| 5 | Root  |
| 6 | Leaf  |
| 8 | Inner |
| 9 | Leaf  |
+---+-------+
Explanation:
- Node 5 is the root node since it has no parent node.
- Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 are leaf nodes because they don't have any child nodes.
- Nodes 2, and 8 are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.
```

**Note:** This question is the same as [608: Tree Node.](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/description/)

## Solutions

To determine the type of each node in a binary tree, we classify based on the following logic:

---

### **Definitions**

- **Root**: Node with no parent (`P IS NULL`)
- **Inner**: Node that appears as a parent to at least one other node
- **Leaf**: Node that is not a parent and also has a parent (`P IS NOT NULL` and does not appear in column `P`)

---

### âœ… SQL Query

```SQL
SELECT
  N,
  CASE
    WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
    WHEN N IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM Tree WHERE P IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Inner'
    ELSE 'Leaf'
  END AS Type
FROM Tree
ORDER BY N;
```

### ðŸ’¡ Explanation

1. **Root**: Directly detected via `P IS NULL`.
2. **Inner**: Appears in column `P` (i.e., has at least one child).
3. **Leaf**: Has a parent (`P IS NOT NULL`) and does **not** appear as a parent.

This is efficient and uses only a single subquery for identifying parent nodes.

Would you like an extension to return tree depth or parent-child relationships next?
