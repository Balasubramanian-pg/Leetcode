Table: `Teacher`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| teacher_id  | int  |
| subject_id  | int  |
| dept_id     | int  |
+-------------+------+
(subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.
```

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Teacher table:
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |
+------------+------------+---------+
Output:
+------------+-----+
| teacher_id | cnt |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |
+------------+-----+
Explanation:
Teacher 1:
  - They teach subject 2 in departments 3 and 4.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 3.
Teacher 2:
  - They teach subject 1 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 2 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 3 in department 1.
  - They teach subject 4 in department 1.

# Counting Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher

To solve this problem, I need to calculate how many different subjects each teacher teaches, regardless of which department they teach them in.

## Approach

1. **Group by Teacher**: Group the records by teacher_id
2. **Count Distinct Subjects**: For each teacher, count the number of unique subject_ids
3. **Select Output Columns**: Return teacher_id and the count of unique subjects

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    teacher_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM
    Teacher
GROUP BY
    teacher_id;
```

## Explanation

1. `GROUP BY teacher_id` creates groups for each teacher
2. `COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)` counts how many different subjects each teacher teaches
3. The result shows:
    - Teacher 1 teaches 2 unique subjects (subjects 2 and 3)
    - Teacher 2 teaches 4 unique subjects (subjects 1, 2, 3, and 4)

This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique subjects per teacher by using DISTINCT within the COUNT function to avoid counting duplicate subjects taught in different departments.
