Table: `Person`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

Write a solution to **delete** all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest `id`.

For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a `DELETE` statement and not a `SELECT` one.

For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify `Person` in place.

After running your script, the answer shown is the `Person` table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the `Person` table. The final order of the `Person` table **does not matter**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
```

# Deleting Duplicate Emails (Keeping Smallest ID)

To solve this problem, I need to delete all duplicate email records from the Person table while keeping only one copy of each unique email - specifically the one with the smallest id.

## Approach

1. **Identify Duplicates**: First, I need to find all emails that appear more than once in the table.
2. **Keep Minimum ID**: For each duplicate email, I want to keep only the record with the smallest id.
3. **Delete Others**: Delete all other records that have the same email but larger ids.

## Solution Code

```SQL
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1, Person p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;
```

## Explanation

- The query uses a self-join on the Person table to compare each email with all other emails in the table.
- The condition `p1.email = p2.email` ensures we're looking at duplicate emails.
- The condition `p1.id > p2.id` ensures we only target records where the id is larger than another record with the same email.
- The DELETE statement removes all such records, leaving only the email with the smallest id for each duplicate group.
- In the example, this keeps id=1 for "john@example.com" and deletes id=3, while "bob@example.com" remains as it's unique.

This approach efficiently removes duplicates while preserving the record with the smallest id for each email group. The self-join technique is particularly effective for this type of operation in SQL.
