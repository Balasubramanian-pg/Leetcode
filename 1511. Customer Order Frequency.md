This table contains information about the customers in the company.
```

```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain

customer_id is the id of the customer who bought "quantity" products with id "product_id".
Order_date is the date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD') when the order was shipped.
```

Write a solution to report the `customer_id` and `customer_name` of customers who have spent at least `$100` in each month of **June and July 2020**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Output:
+--------------+------------+
| customer_id  | name       |
+--------------+------------+
| 1            | Winston    |
+--------------+------------+
Explanation:
Winston spent $300 (300 * 1) in June and $100 ( 10 * 1 + 45 * 2) in July 2020.
Jonathan spent $600 (300 * 2) in June and $20 ( 2 * 10) in July 2020.
Moustafa spent $110 (10 * 2 + 45 * 2) in June and $0 in July 2020.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem to find customers who spent at least $100 in both June and July 2020.

The task requires us to:

1. Calculate each customer's total spending per month (June and July 2020)
2. Filter for customers who spent at least $100 in both months
3. Return their customer_id and name

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    -- Customers who spent >= $100 in June 2020
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Product p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30'
    GROUP BY o.customer_id
    HAVING SUM(o.quantity * p.price) >= 100
)
AND c.customer_id IN (
    -- Customers who spent >= $100 in July 2020
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Product p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
    WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-07-01' AND '2020-07-31'
    GROUP BY o.customer_id
    HAVING SUM(o.quantity * p.price) >= 100
);
```

Let's verify with the example data:

For Winston (customer_id = 1):

- June: 1 LC Phone at $300 = $300 (≥ $100)
- July: 1 LC T-Shirt at $10 + 2 LC Books at $45 each = $100 (≥ $100)  
    So Winston meets the criteria.  
    

For Jonathan (customer_id = 2):

- June: 2 LC Phones at $300 each = $600 (≥ $100)
- July: 10 LC Keychains at $2 each = $20 (< $100)  
    Jonathan doesn't meet the criteria because July spending is less than $100.  
    

For Moustafa (customer_id = 3):

- June: 2 LC T-Shirts at $10 each + 2 LC Books at $45 each = $110 (≥ $100)
- July: No orders = $0 (< $100)  
    Moustafa doesn't meet the criteria because July spending is less than $100.  
    

Therefore, only Winston (customer_id = 1) should be in the results, which matches the expected output.
