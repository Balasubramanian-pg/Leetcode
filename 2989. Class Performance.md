**Description**

Table: `Scores`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |
| assignment1  | int     |
| assignment2  | int     |
| assignment3  | int     |
+--------------+---------+
student_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains student_id, student_name, assignment1, assignment2, and assignment3.
```

Return _the result table in **any** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Scores table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| student_id | student_name | assignment1 | assignment2 | assignment3 |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 309        | Owen         | 88          | 47          | 87          |
| 321        | Claire       | 98          | 95          | 37          |

Explanation
- student_id 309 has a total score of 88 + 47 + 87 = 222.
- student_id 321 has a total score of 98 + 95 + 37 = 230.
- student_id 338 has a total score of 100 + 64 + 43 = 207.
- student_id 423 has a total score of 60 + 44 + 47 = 151.
- student_id 896 has a total score of 32 + 37 + 50 = 119.
- student_id 235 has a total score of 31 + 53 + 69 = 153.
student_id 321 has the highest score of 230, while student_id 896 has the lowest score of 119. Therefore, the difference between them is 111.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest total scores obtained by any student. The total score for a student is the sum of their scores on `assignment1`, `assignment2`, and `assignment3`.

We will be working with the `Scores` table.

Step 1: For each student, we need to calculate their total score. This is simply the sum of their three assignment scores. While we don't need to show this for each student in the final output, we need to calculate it conceptually to find the maximum and minimum later. The calculation for a single student's total score is `assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3`.

Step 2: We need to find the maximum total score among _all_ students. We can do this using the `MAX()` aggregate function applied to the total score calculation from Step 1.

```SQL
SELECT
    MAX(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3) AS highest_total_score
FROM Scores;
-- This finds the single highest total score achieved by any student in the table.
```

Explanation: We use the `MAX()` function. Inside the function, we put the calculation for a student's total score (`assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3`). `MAX()` finds the largest value resulting from this calculation across all rows in the `Scores` table (since there's no `GROUP BY`).

Step 3: We also need to find the minimum total score among _all_ students. Similar to Step 2, we use the `MIN()` aggregate function with the total score calculation.

```SQL
SELECT
    MIN(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3) AS lowest_total_score
FROM Scores;
-- This finds the single lowest total score achieved by any student in the table.
```

Explanation: We use the `MIN()` function, again with the total score calculation `assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3`. `MIN()` finds the smallest value resulting from this calculation across all rows.

Step 4: The problem asks for the _difference_ between the highest and lowest total scores. We can calculate both the maximum and minimum total scores in a single `SELECT` statement and then subtract the minimum from the maximum. Since the order doesn't matter, we just need one row with the final calculation. The problem asks for the _absolute_ difference, meaning we should use the `ABS()` function to ensure the result is not negative.

```SQL
SELECT
    -- Calculate the absolute difference between the highest and lowest total scores
    ABS(MAX(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3) - MIN(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3)) AS difference_in_score
FROM Scores;
-- This calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum total scores and takes the absolute value.
-- The result column is named as required.
```

Explanation: We perform the subtraction `MAX(...) - MIN(...)` using the calculations from Steps 2 and 3 within a single `SELECT` statement. The `ABS(...)` function ensures that the result is always a non-negative number. The calculated value is aliased as `difference_in_score` as requested for the output column name.

This single query performs all the necessary steps: calculating the total score implicitly for each student, finding the max and min of these totals, calculating the absolute difference, and naming the output column.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    ABS(MAX(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3) - MIN(assignment1 + assignment2 + assignment3)) AS difference_in_score
FROM Scores;
```
