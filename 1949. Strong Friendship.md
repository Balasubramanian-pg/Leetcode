**Description**

Table: `Friendship`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user1_id    | int  |
| user2_id    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id < user2_id.
```

A friendship between a pair of friends `x` and `y` is **strong** if `x` and `y` have **at least three** common friends.

Write a solution to find all the **strong friendships**.

Note that the result table should not contain duplicates with `user1_id < user2_id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 1        | 7        |
| 3        | 7        |
| 1        | 6        |
| 3        | 6        |
| 2        | 6        |
+----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+----------+---------------+
| user1_id | user2_id | common_friend |
+----------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 2        | 4             |
| 1        | 3        | 3             |
+----------+----------+---------------+
Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 have 4 common friends (3, 4, 5, and 6).
Users 1 and 3 have 3 common friends (2, 6, and 7).
We did not include the friendship of users 2 and 3 because they only have two common friends (1 and 6).
```

## Solutions

Let me solve this SQL problem step-by-step, breaking down the logic to find strong friendships.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find pairs of friends who have at least 3 common friends (a "strong friendship"). We need to:

1. Identify each friendship pair
2. Count how many common friends they have
3. Filter for pairs with at least 3 common friends

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Understand the friendship relationships

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Friendship
```

Explanation: First, let's understand our data. The Friendship table has pairs of user IDs where user1_id < user2_id. Each row represents a friendship between two users.

## Step 2: Find common friends for each pair

```SQL
SELECT f1.user1_id, f1.user2_id, f2.user2_id AS common_friend
FROM Friendship f1
JOIN Friendship f2 ON f1.user1_id = f2.user1_id AND f1.user2_id <> f2.user2_id
```

Explanation: This initial approach tries to find common friends by joining the table with itself. We're looking for cases where user1 from the first pair (f1) is friends with both user2 from f1 and another user from f2.

## Step 3: Rethinking our approach with a more comprehensive join

```SQL
SELECT a.user1_id, a.user2_id, c.user_id AS common_friend
FROM Friendship a
JOIN (
    -- Create a flattened view of all friendships
    SELECT user1_id AS user_id, user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2_id AS user_id, user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
) b ON a.user1_id = b.user_id
JOIN (
    -- Create a flattened view of all friendships
    SELECT user1_id AS user_id, user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2_id AS user_id, user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
) c ON a.user2_id = c.user_id AND b.friend_id = c.friend_id
```

Explanation: This approach wasn't quite right. The problem is more complex because we need to consider friendships in both directions. Let's rethink.

## Step 4: Correctly identifying common friends

```SQL
WITH FriendPairs AS (
    -- Create a normalized view where each friendship appears twice (in both directions)
    SELECT user1_id AS user_id, user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2_id AS user_id, user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
)
SELECT
    f.user1_id,
    f.user2_id,
    COUNT(*) AS common_friend
FROM
    Friendship f,
    FriendPairs fp1,
    FriendPairs fp2
WHERE
    f.user1_id = fp1.user_id AND
    f.user2_id = fp2.user_id AND
    fp1.friend_id = fp2.friend_id
GROUP BY
    f.user1_id, f.user2_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) >= 3
```

Explanation: Here we first create a normalized view of friendships where each relationship appears in both directions. Then we join this with the original Friendship table to find pairs where both users are friends with the same third person (a common friend).

## Step 5: Final solution with optimized and clear logic

```SQL
WITH FriendPairs AS (
    -- Create a normalized view of friendships in both directions
    SELECT user1_id AS user_id, user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2_id AS user_id, user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
)
SELECT
    f.user1_id,
    f.user2_id,
    COUNT(*) AS common_friend
FROM
    Friendship f
JOIN FriendPairs fp1 ON f.user1_id = fp1.user_id
JOIN FriendPairs fp2 ON f.user2_id = fp2.user_id AND fp1.friend_id = fp2.friend_id
GROUP BY
    f.user1_id, f.user2_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) >= 3
```

Explanation: This optimized solution uses explicit JOINs to find common friends between each friendship pair. We're joining the normalized friendship view twice - once for each user in the friendship - and matching when both users are friends with the same person.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH FriendPairs AS (
    -- Create a normalized view of friendships in both directions
    SELECT user1_id AS user_id, user2_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2_id AS user_id, user1_id AS friend_id FROM Friendship
)
SELECT
    f.user1_id,
    f.user2_id,
    COUNT(*) AS common_friend
FROM
    Friendship f
JOIN FriendPairs fp1 ON f.user1_id = fp1.user_id
JOIN FriendPairs fp2 ON f.user2_id = fp2.user_id AND fp1.friend_id = fp2.friend_id
GROUP BY
    f.user1_id, f.user2_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) >= 3
```

This query works by:

1. Creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) that normalizes friendships to show each relationship in both directions
2. Joining this normalized view with the original Friendship table
3. Finding pairs where both users in a friendship are also friends with the same third person
4. Counting these common friends and filtering for pairs with at least 3
5. Returning the user1_id, user2_id, and the count of common friends

The solution correctly identifies strong friendships like those between users 1 and 2 (4 common friends) and users 1 and 3 (3 common friends), meeting all requirements of the problem.
