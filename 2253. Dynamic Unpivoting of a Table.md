**Description**

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| store_name1 | int     |
| store_name2 | int     |
|      :      | int     |
|      :      | int     |
|      :      | int     |
| store_namen | int     |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table indicates the product's price in n different stores.
If the product is not available in a store, the price will be null in that store's column.
The names of the stores may change from one testcase to another. There will be at least 1 store and at most 30 stores.
```

**Important note:** This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.

Implement the procedure `UnpivotProducts` to reorganize the `Products`  
table so that each row has the id of one product, the name of a store  
where it is sold, and its price in that store. If a product is not  
available in a store, do **not** include a row with that `product_id` and `store` combination in the result table. There should be three columns: `product_id`, `store`, and `price`.

The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
| product_id | LC_Store | Nozama | Shop | Souq |
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
| 1          | 100      | null   | 110  | null |
| 2          | null     | 200    | null | 190  |
| 3          | null     | null   | 1000 | 1900 |
+------------+----------+--------+------+------+
Output:
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | store    | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 1          | LC_Store | 100   |
| 1          | Shop     | 110   |
| 2          | Nozama   | 200   |
| 2          | Souq     | 190   |
| 3          | Shop     | 1000  |
| 3          | Souq     | 1900  |
+------------+----------+-------+
Explanation:
Product 1 is sold in LC_Store and Shop with prices of 100 and 110 respectively.
Product 2 is sold in Nozama and Souq with prices of 200 and 190.
Product 3 is sold in Shop and Souq with prices of 1000 and 1900.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This is an unpivot problem - the opposite of the pivot problem we just solved. Now we need to:

1. Transform columns into rows where each store column becomes a row
2. Include only rows where the product has a non-null price in that store
3. The final result should have three columns: product_id, store, and price

Like the pivot problem, this requires dynamic SQL since we need to handle an unknown number of store columns.

## Step 1: Identify the approach

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE UnpivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- This is where our logic will go
END
```

Explanation: We start by creating the procedure. For an unpivot operation, we'll need to use dynamic SQL to handle variable column names.

## Step 2: Understanding the UNPIVOT concept

```SQL
-- Conceptual unpivot (not valid syntax in MySQL)
SELECT product_id, store, price
FROM Products
UNPIVOT (
    price FOR store IN (LC_Store, Nozama, Shop, Souq)
) AS unpivoted
WHERE price IS NOT NULL
```

Explanation: This is a conceptual representation of what we want to achieve. However, MySQL doesn't have a direct UNPIVOT operator, so we need to implement it using other means.

## Step 3: Using dynamic SQL with UNION ALL

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE UnpivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- Create a variable to hold our dynamic SQL statement
    SET @sql = NULL;

    -- Get all column names except product_id
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(
             CONCAT('SELECT product_id, ''', column_name, ''' AS store, `', column_name, '` AS price ',
                    'FROM Products WHERE `', column_name, '` IS NOT NULL')
             SEPARATOR ' UNION ALL ')
    INTO @sql
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = DATABASE()
      AND table_name = 'Products'
      AND column_name != 'product_id';

    -- Prepare and execute the statement
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END
```

Explanation: This dynamic SQL approach:

1. Gets all column names from the Products table except product_id
2. For each column, creates a SELECT statement that returns product_id, the column name as 'store', and the column value as 'price'
3. Combines these SELECT statements with UNION ALL
4. Adds a WHERE condition to filter out null prices
5. Prepares and executes the combined statement

## Final Solution:

```SQL
CREATE PROCEDURE UnpivotProducts()
BEGIN
    -- Create a variable to hold our dynamic SQL statement
    SET @sql = NULL;

    -- Get all column names except product_id
    SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(
             CONCAT('SELECT product_id, ''', column_name, ''' AS store, `', column_name, '` AS price ',
                    'FROM Products WHERE `', column_name, '` IS NOT NULL')
             SEPARATOR ' UNION ALL ')
    INTO @sql
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = DATABASE()
      AND table_name = 'Products'
      AND column_name != 'product_id';

    -- Prepare and execute the statement
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Creates a procedure called UnpivotProducts as required
2. Uses dynamic SQL to generate an unpivot query that can handle any number of store columns
3. Creates a UNION ALL of select statements, one for each store column
4. Each select statement retrieves the product_id, the store name, and the price
5. Includes only rows where the price is not NULL
6. Returns the table in the required format with three columns: product_id, store, and price

This dynamic SQL approach is flexible and will work with any number of store columns, adapting automatically to the structure of the Products table.
