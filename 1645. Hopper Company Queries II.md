**Note** that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the `working_percentage` to be `0`.

Return the result table ordered by `month` in **ascending** order, where `month` is the month's number (January is `1`, February is `2`, etc.). Round `working_percentage` to the nearest **2 decimal places**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to calculate the percentage of working drivers for each month of 2020, where:

- A working driver is one who has at least one accepted ride during that month
- The percentage is calculated as (number of working drivers / number of available drivers) * 100
- Available drivers are those who joined by the end of that month
- If there are no available drivers, the percentage is 0
- Results should be rounded to 2 decimal places and ordered by month

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Create a months table to ensure all months of 2020 appear in our report

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
)
SELECT month FROM months;
```

Explanation: First, we create a Common Table Expression (CTE) that generates all 12 months. This ensures our final result includes all months of 2020, even if there are no drivers or rides in some months.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of available drivers by the end of each month

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
available_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS drivers_count
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= DATE_FORMAT(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-31'), '%Y-%m-%d')
    GROUP BY
        m.month
)
SELECT * FROM available_drivers;
```

Explanation: Here we count all drivers who joined by the end of each month in 2020 or earlier. We join our months CTE with the Drivers table, filtering to include only drivers who joined before or during each month.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of working drivers for each month

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
working_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ar.driver_id) AS drivers_working
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT * FROM working_drivers;
```

Explanation: Now we're counting working drivers for each month in 2020. A working driver is one who has accepted at least one ride during that month. We use COUNT(DISTINCT) to count each driver only once per month, even if they completed multiple rides.

### Step 4: Combine both calculations to determine the working percentage

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
available_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS drivers_count
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= LAST_DAY(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-01'))
    GROUP BY
        m.month
),
working_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ar.driver_id) AS drivers_working
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    CASE
        WHEN ad.drivers_count = 0 THEN 0.00
        ELSE ROUND((COALESCE(wd.drivers_working, 0) / ad.drivers_count) * 100, 2)
    END AS working_percentage
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    available_drivers ad ON m.month = ad.month
LEFT JOIN
    working_drivers wd ON m.month = wd.month
ORDER BY
    m.month;
```

Explanation: This query combines both CTEs to calculate the working percentage. For each month, we divide the number of working drivers by the number of available drivers and multiply by 100. We handle the case where there are no available drivers by returning 0. The results are rounded to 2 decimal places and ordered by month.

### Step 5: Ensure correct formatting with ROUND function

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
available_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS drivers_count
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= LAST_DAY(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-01'))
    GROUP BY
        m.month
),
working_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ar.driver_id) AS drivers_working
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    ROUND(
        CASE
            WHEN ad.drivers_count = 0 THEN 0.00
            ELSE (COALESCE(wd.drivers_working, 0) / ad.drivers_count) * 100
        END,
    2) AS working_percentage
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    available_drivers ad ON m.month = ad.month
LEFT JOIN
    working_drivers wd ON m.month = wd.month
ORDER BY
    m.month;
```

Explanation: We've adjusted the rounding to ensure we get exactly 2 decimal places as required in the problem statement. The ROUND function takes two arguments: the value to round and the number of decimal places.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
available_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS available_count
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= LAST_DAY(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-01'))
    GROUP BY
        m.month
),
working_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(DISTINCT ar.driver_id) AS working_count
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    ROUND(
        CASE
            WHEN COALESCE(ad.available_count, 0) = 0 THEN 0
            ELSE (COALESCE(wd.working_count, 0) / ad.available_count) * 100
        END,
    2) AS working_percentage
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    available_drivers ad ON m.month = ad.month
LEFT JOIN
    working_drivers wd ON m.month = wd.month
ORDER BY
    m.month;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution. We create three CTEs: one for all months, one for available drivers per month, and one for working drivers per month. We then join these together to calculate the working percentage, handling the case where there are no available drivers by returning 0. The results are rounded to 2 decimal places and ordered by month as required.
