Table: `Person`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Person table:
+----+---------+
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.
```

# Finding Duplicate Emails

To solve this problem, I need to identify all email addresses that appear more than once in the Person table. Since it's guaranteed that the email field is not NULL, I can focus solely on counting occurrences of each email.

## Approach

1. **Grouping by Email**: I'll group all records in the Person table by their email address.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: For each email group, I'll count how many times it appears.
3. **Filtering Duplicates**: I'll filter to only include email groups that have a count greater than 1 (indicating duplicates).
4. **Selecting Result**: Finally, I'll select just the email addresses from these groups.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT email AS Email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(email) > 1;
```

## Explanation

- The query starts by selecting the `email` column from the Person table.
- The `GROUP BY email` clause groups all records with the same email address together.
- The `HAVING COUNT(email) > 1` condition filters these groups to only include those where the count of emails is greater than 1 (duplicates).
- The result is a list of email addresses that appear more than once in the table. In the example, "a@b.com" appears twice, so it's correctly identified as a duplicate.

This approach efficiently finds duplicates by leveraging SQL's grouping and aggregation functions, which are optimized for this type of operation.
