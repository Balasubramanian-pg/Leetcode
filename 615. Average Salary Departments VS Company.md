+-----------+---------------+------------+
Explanation:
In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...
The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of employee_id '1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.
The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of employee_id '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.
```

**Solutions**

# SQL Problem: Department Salary Comparison

Let me analyze this SQL problem about comparing departmental salary averages to company-wide averages.

## Problem Analysis

I need to determine whether each department's average salary is higher, lower, or the same as the company's average salary for each month.

**My thought process:**  
When I first look at this problem, I'm thinking about how to group and compare data effectively. We need to:  

1. Group salary data by month and department
2. Calculate the company-wide average salary for each month
3. Calculate each department's average salary for each month
4. Compare these averages and categorize them

The complexity comes from needing to make these comparisons across multiple dimensions (both time and department).

## Approach 1: Using Window Functions

**My thought process:**  
Window functions seem perfect for this because they allow us to calculate aggregates over different partitions without reducing the number of rows.  

I'll use:

- `AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY pay_date)` to get company average by date
- `AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY pay_date, department_id)` to get department average by date

Then I can directly compare these values in a CASE statement.

```SQL
WITH t AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month,
        department_id,
        AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY pay_date) AS company_avg_amount,
        AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY pay_date, department_id) AS department_avg_amount
    FROM
        Salary AS s
        JOIN Employee AS e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    pay_month,
    department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN company_avg_amount = department_avg_amount THEN 'same'
        WHEN company_avg_amount < department_avg_amount THEN 'higher'
        ELSE 'lower'
    END AS comparison
FROM t;
```

I'm using DISTINCT because the window functions will give us the same values for each employee in the same department/date, creating duplicates.

## Approach 2: Using Subqueries

**My thought process:**  
We could also solve this with subqueries by first calculating the company average by month, then joining it with department averages:  

```SQL
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(s.pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month,
    e.department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN dept_avg.avg_amount > company_avg.avg_amount THEN 'higher'
        WHEN dept_avg.avg_amount < company_avg.avg_amount THEN 'lower'
        ELSE 'same'
    END AS comparison
FROM Salary s
JOIN Employee e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
        department_id,
        AVG(amount) AS avg_amount
    FROM Salary s
    JOIN Employee e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m'), department_id
) dept_avg ON DATE_FORMAT(s.pay_date, '%Y-%m') = dept_avg.month
    AND e.department_id = dept_avg.department_id
JOIN (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
        AVG(amount) AS avg_amount
    FROM Salary
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m')
) company_avg ON DATE_FORMAT(s.pay_date, '%Y-%m') = company_avg.month
GROUP BY pay_month, department_id;
```

This approach breaks down the problem into smaller pieces but results in more complex joins.

## Approach 3: Common Table Expressions with GROUP BY

**My thought process:**  
Let's combine approaches by using CTEs and GROUP BY:  

```SQL
WITH S AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Salary
    JOIN Employee USING (employee_id)
),
MonthlyAvgs AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month,
        AVG(amount) AS company_avg
    FROM S
    GROUP BY pay_month
),
DeptAvgs AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_FORMAT(pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month,
        department_id,
        AVG(amount) AS dept_avg
    FROM S
    GROUP BY pay_month, department_id
)
SELECT
    d.pay_month,
    d.department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN d.dept_avg > m.company_avg THEN 'higher'
        WHEN d.dept_avg < m.company_avg THEN 'lower'
        ELSE 'same'
    END AS comparison
FROM DeptAvgs d
JOIN MonthlyAvgs m ON d.pay_month = m.pay_month;
```

This is more explicit and might be easier to understand for someone reading the code.

## Alternative: Using GROUP BY with HAVING

**My thought process:**  
Could we solve this using GROUP BY combined with a self-join? Let's try:  

```SQL
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(s1.pay_date, '%Y-%m') AS pay_month,
    e1.department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(s1.amount) > (
            SELECT AVG(s2.amount)
            FROM Salary s2
            WHERE DATE_FORMAT(s1.pay_date, '%Y-%m') = DATE_FORMAT(s2.pay_date, '%Y-%m')
        ) THEN 'higher'
        WHEN AVG(s1.amount) < (
            SELECT AVG(s2.amount)
            FROM Salary s2
            WHERE DATE_FORMAT(s1.pay_date, '%Y-%m') = DATE_FORMAT(s2.pay_date, '%Y-%m')
        ) THEN 'lower'
        ELSE 'same'
    END AS comparison
FROM Salary s1
JOIN Employee e1 ON s1.employee_id = e1.employee_id
GROUP BY pay_month, e1.department_id;
```

This uses correlated subqueries, which might be less efficient for large datasets, but shows another approach.

## Performance Considerations

**My thought process on optimization:**

- The window function approach requires only one join but might use more memory
- The subquery approach breaks calculations down but requires more joins
- Indexing on `employee_id`, `pay_date`, and `department_id` would improve performance
- For very large datasets, the CTE approach might be more maintainable

## Edge Cases to Consider

**My thought process on potential issues:**

1. What if a department has no employees in a particular month?
2. What if all salaries in a month are the same?
3. What if there's only one department?
4. What if we're dealing with floating-point comparison (rounding errors)?

These are all handled correctly by the SQL solutions, but good to consider when testing.

## Conclusion

The window function approach is most elegant for this problem because:

1. It calculates both averages in a single pass
2. It avoids multiple GROUP BY operations
3. It's more concise than the alternatives

Any of these approaches would work, but understanding the problem from multiple angles helps build a deeper understanding of SQL capabilities.
