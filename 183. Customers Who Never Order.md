Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
```

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

# Finding Customers Who Never Ordered

To solve this problem, I need to identify customers who have never placed any orders. This requires comparing the Customers table with the Orders table to find customers whose IDs don't appear in the Orders table.

## Approach

1. **Left Join**: Perform a left join between the Customers table and the Orders table on the customer ID. This will include all customers, whether they've ordered or not.
2. **Filter Null Orders**: After the join, customers who never ordered will have NULL values in the Orders table columns. We can filter for these NULL values.
3. **Select Customer Names**: Finally, select just the customer names from these filtered results.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.id IS NULL;
```

## Explanation

- The query starts by selecting the `name` column from the Customers table (aliased as `c`).
- It performs a LEFT JOIN with the Orders table (aliased as `o`) on the condition that the customer ID matches (`c.id = o.customerId`). This ensures all customers are included in the result, even if they don't have matching orders.
- The WHERE clause filters for rows where the order ID is NULL (`o.id IS NULL`), indicating customers who have no orders.
- The result is a list of customer names who never placed any orders. In the example, "Henry" and "Max" have no corresponding orders, so they are correctly identified.

This approach efficiently finds non-ordering customers by leveraging SQL's join operations and NULL checking, which are well-optimized in database systems.
