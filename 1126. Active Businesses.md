### **Description**

Table: `Events`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| business_id   | int     |
| event_type    | varchar |
| occurrences   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(business_id, event_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.
```

The **average activity** for a particular `event_type` is the average `occurrences` across all companies that have this event.

An **active business** is a business that has **more than one** `event_type` such that their `occurrences` is **strictly greater** than the average activity for that event.

Write a solution to find all **active businesses**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Events table:
+-------------+------------+-------------+
| business_id | event_type | occurrences |
+-------------+------------+-------------+
| 1           | reviews    | 7           |
| 3           | reviews    | 3           |
| 1           | ads        | 11          |
| 2           | ads        | 7           |
| 3           | ads        | 6           |
| 1           | page views | 3           |
| 2           | page views | 12          |
+-------------+------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| business_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
- 'reviews': (7+3)/2 = 5
- 'ads': (11+7+6)/3 = 8
- 'page views': (3+12)/2 = 7.5
The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.
```

### **Solutions**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT business_id
FROM
    EVENTS AS t1
    JOIN (
        SELECT
            event_type,
            AVG(occurences) AS occurences
        FROM EVENTS
        GROUP BY event_type
    ) AS t2
        ON t1.event_type = t2.event_type
WHERE t1.occurences > t2.occurences
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(1) > 1;
```

### **Solution 2**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT
            business_id,
            occurences > AVG(occurences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS mark
        FROM Events
    )
SELECT business_id
FROM T
WHERE mark = 1
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(1) > 1;
```

# Finding Active Businesses with Advanced Aggregation Techniques

I'll walk you through solving this "active businesses" problem with multiple approaches, explaining each step in detail while analyzing the reasoning, performance considerations, and implementation strategies.

## 1. Problem Deconstruction

This problem involves several key concepts:

1. **Average activity calculation** - For each event type, calculate the average occurrences across all businesses
2. **Comparison threshold** - For a business to be "active," its occurrences must be > average (not just â‰¥)
3. **Multiple event types requirement** - A business must exceed the average in MORE THAN ONE event type
4. **Result filtering** - Return only the business_id for active businesses

Let's break this down into logical steps before writing any SQL.

## 2. Conceptual Solution Approach

We need to:

1. Calculate average occurrences for each event_type
2. Compare each business's event occurrences against these averages
3. Count how many event types exceed the average for each business
4. Filter businesses where this count > 1

## 3. Solution : Using JOIN With Derived Table

```SQL
WITH EventAverages AS (
    SELECT
        event_type,
        AVG(occurrences) AS avg_occurrences
    FROM Events
    GROUP BY event_type
)

SELECT
    e.business_id
FROM
    Events e
    JOIN EventAverages ea ON e.event_type = ea.event_type
WHERE e.occurrences > ea.avg_occurrences
GROUP BY e.business_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Calculate Event Type Averages**
    
    ```Plain
    +------------+----------------+
    | event_type | avg_occurrences|
    +------------+----------------+
    | reviews    | 5              |
    | ads        | 8              |
    | page views | 7.5            |
    +------------+----------------+
    ```
    
2. **Join Original Table with Averages**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    | business_id | event_type | occurrences | avg_occurrences|
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    | 1           | reviews    | 7           | 5              |
    | 3           | reviews    | 3           | 5              |
    | 1           | ads        | 11          | 8              |
    | 2           | ads        | 7           | 8              |
    | 3           | ads        | 6           | 8              |
    | 1           | page views | 3           | 7.5            |
    | 2           | page views | 12          | 7.5            |
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    ```
    
3. **Filter Where Occurrences > Average**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    | business_id | event_type | occurrences | avg_occurrences|
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    | 1           | reviews    | 7           | 5              |
    | 1           | ads        | 11          | 8              |
    | 2           | page views | 12          | 7.5            |
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+
    ```
    
4. **Group By Business and Count Events**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+------------------+
    | business_id | COUNT(event_type)|
    +-------------+------------------+
    | 1           | 2                |
    | 2           | 1                |
    +-------------+------------------+
    ```
    
5. **Filter Where Count > 1**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+
    | business_id |
    +-------------+
    | 1           |
    +-------------+
    ```
    

### Execution Analysis:

- This approach uses a simple CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate averages first
- The joining of the Events table to the averages allows for direct comparison
- GROUP BY and HAVING provide the final filtering
- The query reads naturally from top to bottom, matching our logical steps

## 4. Solution #2: Window Functions Approach

```SQL
WITH BusinessEventComparison AS (
    SELECT
        business_id,
        event_type,
        occurrences,
        AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS avg_occurrences,
        CASE
            WHEN occurrences > AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS above_average
    FROM Events
)

SELECT
    business_id
FROM
    BusinessEventComparison
WHERE
    above_average = 1
GROUP BY
    business_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### How Window Functions Transform This Solution:

1. **Data Processing With Window Functions**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
    | business_id | event_type | occurrences | avg_occurrences| above_average|
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
    | 1           | reviews    | 7           | 5              | 1            |
    | 3           | reviews    | 3           | 5              | 0            |
    | 1           | ads        | 11          | 8              | 1            |
    | 2           | ads        | 7           | 8              | 0            |
    | 3           | ads        | 6           | 8              | 0            |
    | 1           | page views | 3           | 7.5            | 0            |
    | 2           | page views | 12          | 7.5            | 1            |
    +-------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
    ```
    
2. **Filtering & Aggregation**
    - Filter only the rows where above_average = 1
    - Group by business_id and count rows
    - Keep only businesses with count > 1
3. **Final Result**
    
    ```Plain
    +-------------+
    | business_id |
    +-------------+
    | 1           |
    +-------------+
    ```
    

### Window Function Mechanics:

- `AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type)` calculates the average for each event_type
- The calculation happens without reducing the number of rows
- Each row retains its original values while gaining the context of the average
- The CASE statement creates a flag identifying rows that exceed the average

## 5. Solution #3: Simplified Window Function Approach

We can make the window function approach even more elegant:

```SQL
WITH EventFlags AS (
    SELECT
        business_id,
        occurrences > AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS is_above_avg
    FROM Events
)

SELECT
    business_id
FROM
    EventFlags
WHERE
    is_above_avg = 1
GROUP BY
    business_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Optimization Analysis:

- This removes unnecessary columns for a cleaner CTE
- Uses boolean expression directly in the SELECT clause
- Maintains the same logical flow but with less code
- More efficient for the database to process

## 6. Solution #4: Subquery Approach Without CTEs

For databases without CTE support or for a different mental model:

```SQL
SELECT
    business_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        e.business_id,
        e.event_type,
        e.occurrences,
        (SELECT AVG(occurrences) FROM Events WHERE event_type = e.event_type) AS avg_occurrences
    FROM
        Events e
) AS comparison
WHERE
    occurrences > avg_occurrences
GROUP BY
    business_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Query Processing Flow:

1. The inner subquery calculates average occurrences for each event type using a correlated subquery
2. The outer query filters, groups, and applies the HAVING clause
3. The final result shows only active businesses

### Performance Consideration:

- Correlated subqueries can be inefficient for large datasets
- The database may need to calculate averages repeatedly
- Modern query optimizers might rewrite this internally to be more efficient
- This approach might be more intuitive for those familiar with procedural programming

## 7. Solution #5: Self-Join Approach

An alternative approach using a self-join:

```SQL
SELECT
    e1.business_id
FROM
    Events e1
JOIN (
    SELECT
        event_type,
        AVG(occurrences) AS avg_occurrences
    FROM
        Events
    GROUP BY
        event_type
) e2 ON e1.event_type = e2.event_type
WHERE
    e1.occurrences > e2.avg_occurrences
GROUP BY
    e1.business_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Join Mechanics:

- The derived table calculates averages for each event_type
- The main table joins with these averages for comparison
- Filtering happens in the WHERE clause based on this comparison
- GROUP BY and HAVING control the final result set

## 8. Performance Analysis & Optimization

### Query Performance Factors:

1. **Table Size Considerations**
    - For small tables: Any approach is fine
    - For medium tables: Window functions often perform best
    - For large tables: Proper indexing becomes critical
2. **Index Recommendations**
    - Primary index on (business_id, event_type) already exists
    - An additional index on (event_type, occurrences) could help with average calculations
3. **Execution Plan Analysis**
    - Window function approach typically requires:
        - Full table scan
        - Sort operation for each PARTITION BY
        - Hash aggregation for GROUP BY
    - JOIN approach typically requires:
        - Full table scan for average calculation
        - Hash join to combine results
        - Hash aggregation for final grouping
4. **Memory Consumption**
    - Window functions may require more memory for sorting operations
    - JOIN approaches can be more memory efficient with proper hash join implementation

## 9. Conceptual Understanding: Building Mental Models

### Average Calculation Deep Dive:

For the example data, let's trace the exact average calculations:

- **Reviews**: (7+3)/2 = 5
- **Ads**: (11+7+6)/3 = 8
- **Page views**: (3+12)/2 = 7.5

### Business Analysis:

- **Business 1**:
    - Reviews: 7 > 5 âœ“
    - Ads: 11 > 8 âœ“
    - Page views: 3 < 7.5 âœ—
    - Count of above average: 2 > 1, so it's active
- **Business 2**:
    - Ads: 7 < 8 âœ—
    - Page views: 12 > 7.5 âœ“
    - Count of above average: 1 = 1, so it's NOT active (must be > 1)
- **Business 3**:
    - Reviews: 3 < 5 âœ—
    - Ads: 6 < 8 âœ—
    - Count of above average: 0 < 1, so it's NOT active

## 10. Edge Case Analysis

### Important Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Equal to Average**
    - If occurrences = avg_occurrences, it doesn't count (must be strictly greater)
    - Solution handles this correctly with ">" not ">="
2. **Single Event Type Business**
    - A business with only one event type can never be "active" by definition
    - Our HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 handles this, but businesses must actually exceed the average
3. **Zero Occurrences**
    - Not in the example, but zero values would be included in averages
    - Might produce averages of 0 for event types with all zeros
    - Our solution handles this correctly
4. **NULL Occurrences**
    - If occurrences could be NULL (not in this schema), they would be excluded from AVG()
    - Solutions would need to handle this with COALESCE or IS NOT NULL checks

## 11. Final Recommendation: Window Function Solution

The most elegant and efficient solution for modern databases:

```SQL
WITH EventComparison AS (
    SELECT
        business_id,
        occurrences > AVG(occurrences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS is_above_avg
    FROM Events
)

SELECT
    business_id
FROM
    EventComparison
WHERE
    is_above_avg = TRUE
GROUP BY
    business_id
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Why This Solution Is Optimal:

1. **Clarity**: Expresses the business logic clearly with minimal code
2. **Performance**: Single-pass calculation of averages with window functions
3. **Readability**: The boolean flag creates self-documenting code
4. **Maintenance**: Easy to modify if requirements change
5. **Efficiency**: Modern database optimizers handle window functions well

## 12. SQL Design Principles Learned

1. **Aggregate first, filter later**: Calculate metrics before applying filters
2. **Use appropriate abstractions**: Window functions for comparing within groups
3. **Boolean expressions for clarity**: Direct expressions are often clearer than CASE
4. **CTEs for logical separation**: Break complex problems into manageable pieces
5. **Think in sets, not loops**: SQL works best with set-based operations

By understanding these core SQL patterns and the underlying data processing model, you can tackle similar aggregation and comparison problems with confidence.
