**Description**

Table: `Loans`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| loan_id     | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
| loan_type   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
loan_id is column of unique values for this table.
This table contains loan_id, user_id, and loan_type.
```

Write a solution to find all **distinct** `user_id`'s that have **at least one Refinance** loan type and at least one **Mortgage** loan type.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Loans table:
+---------+---------+-----------+
| loan_id | user_id | loan_type |
+---------+---------+-----------+
| 683     | 101     | Mortgage  |
| 218     | 101     | AutoLoan  |
| 802     | 101     | Inschool  |
| 593     | 102     | Mortgage  |
| 138     | 102     | Refinance |
| 294     | 102     | Inschool  |
| 308     | 103     | Refinance |
| 389     | 104     | Mortgage  |
+---------+---------+-----------+
Output
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 102     |
+---------+
Explanation
- User_id 101 has three loan types, one of which is a Mortgage. However, this user does not have any loan type categorized as Refinance, so user_id 101 won't be considered.
- User_id 102 possesses three loan types: one for Mortgage and one for Refinance. Hence, user_id 102 will be included in the result.
- User_id 103 has a loan type of Refinance but lacks a Mortgage loan type, so user_id 103 won't be considered.
- User_id 104 has a Mortgage loan type but doesn't have a Refinance loan type, thus, user_id 104 won't be considered.
Output table is ordered by user_id in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find users who have _both_ a 'Refinance' loan and a 'Mortgage' loan listed in the `Loans` table. We need to return the unique IDs of these users, ordered by user ID.

We will work with the `Loans` table. Since we need to check for the presence of specific loan types _for each user_, we'll likely need to group the data by user.

Step 1: We need to look at each user's loans. We can start by selecting the `user_id` and grouping the results by `user_id`. This allows us to perform checks on all loans belonging to a single user at once.

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id
FROM Loans
GROUP BY user_id;
-- This groups all loans by the user who took them out.
```

Explanation: We select the `user_id` from the `Loans` table and use `GROUP BY user_id`. This collects all rows belonging to the same user into a single group, which is necessary to evaluate all of a user's loans together.

Step 2: Now that the loans are grouped by user, for each user group, we need to check if there is at least one loan with `loan_type = 'Refinance'` AND at least one loan with `loan_type = 'Mortgage'`. We can use the `HAVING` clause to filter these groups. Inside the `HAVING` clause, we can use conditional aggregation to count how many loans of each type the user has.

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id
FROM Loans
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING
    -- Check if the user has at least one 'Refinance' loan
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Refinance' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
    AND
    -- Check if the user has at least one 'Mortgage' loan
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Mortgage' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0;
-- This filters the user groups. Only users who have recorded both a 'Refinance' AND a 'Mortgage' loan are kept.
```

Explanation: The `HAVING` clause filters the results _after_ grouping.

- `SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Refinance' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`: This is a conditional sum. For each row within a user's group, if `loan_type` is 'Refinance', it adds 1 to the sum; otherwise, it adds 0. The total sum for a user is the count of their 'Refinance' loans. `> 0` checks if this count is at least one.
- `SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Mortgage' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0`: This does the same check for 'Mortgage' loans.
- `AND`: Both conditions must be true for the user group to be included in the final result. This finds users who have _both_ types of loans.

Step 3: The problem asks for distinct `user_id`s. Our current query with `GROUP BY user_id` already produces unique user IDs. We just need to make sure the column name is `user_id` and apply the required ordering.

Step 4: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id
FROM Loans
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Refinance' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
    AND
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Mortgage' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
ORDER BY user_id ASC; -- Order the final output by user ID
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY user_id ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final list of user IDs from smallest to largest.

This query correctly identifies users with both required loan types using grouping and conditional aggregation and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id
FROM Loans
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Refinance' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
    AND
    SUM(CASE WHEN loan_type = 'Mortgage' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
```
