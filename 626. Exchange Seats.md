Table: `Seat`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
```

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive  
students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student  
is not swapped.  

Return the result table ordered by `id` **in ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation:
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.
```

# Solution to Swap Consecutive Student Seats

To solve this problem, I need to swap the seat IDs of every two consecutive students while handling both even and odd numbers of students. The key is to:

1. Swap each even ID with the previous odd ID
2. Leave the last ID unchanged if the total count is odd

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM Seat) THEN id
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 THEN id + 1
        ELSE id - 1
    END AS id,
    student
FROM
    Seat
ORDER BY
    id;
```

## Alternative Solution (Using Window Functions)

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id = MAX(id) OVER () THEN id
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 THEN id + 1
        ELSE id - 1
    END AS id,
    student
FROM
    Seat
ORDER BY
    id;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Identify Odd and Even IDs**:
    - `id % 2 = 1` checks for odd-numbered IDs
    - `id % 2 = 0` would check for even-numbered IDs
2. **Handle the Last Odd ID**:
    - Check if the current ID is both odd AND the maximum ID in the table
    - If true, keep the ID as-is (no swap for last student in odd count)
3. **Swap Logic**:
    - For odd IDs (not last): swap with next student (id + 1)
    - For even IDs: swap with previous student (id - 1)
4. **Ordering**:
    - Results are ordered by original ID to maintain sequence

## Example Walkthrough

For the input:

```Plain
1 - Abbot
2 - Doris
3 - Emerson
4 - Green
5 - Jeames
```

Processing:

1. ID 1 (odd, not last) → becomes 2
2. ID 2 (even) → becomes 1
3. ID 3 (odd, not last) → becomes 4
4. ID 4 (even) → becomes 3
5. ID 5 (odd AND last) → stays 5

Result:

```Plain
1 - Doris (originally ID 2)
2 - Abbot (originally ID 1)
3 - Green (originally ID 4)
4 - Emerson (originally ID 3)
5 - Jeames (unchanged)
```

The solution efficiently handles both even and odd numbers of students while maintaining the correct order in the output.
