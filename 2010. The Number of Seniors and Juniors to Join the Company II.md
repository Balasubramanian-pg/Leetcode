**Description**

Table: `Candidates`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| employee_id | int  |
| experience  | enum |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
employee_id is the column with unique values for this table.
experience is an ENUM (category) of types ('Senior', 'Junior').
Each row of this table indicates the id of a candidate, their monthly salary, and their experience.
The salary of each candidate is guaranteed to beunique.
```

A company wants to hire new employees. The budget of the company for the salaries is `$70000`. The company's criteria for hiring are:

1. Keep hiring the senior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more seniors.
2. Use the remaining budget to hire the junior with the smallest salary.
3. Keep hiring the junior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more juniors.

Write a solution to find the ids of seniors and juniors hired under the mentioned criteria.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 15000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 20000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 16000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 50000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
| 2           |
| 1           |
| 9           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (11, 2). Since the budget is $70000 and the sum of their salaries is $36000, we still have $34000 but they are not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is $34000 and the sum of their salaries is $25000, we still have $9000 but they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 25000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 85000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 80000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 90000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 30000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 9           |
| 1           |
| 4           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
We cannot hire any seniors with the current budget as we need at least $80000 to hire one senior.
We can hire all three juniors with the remaining budget.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, working through the logic to find the IDs of hired employees based on the given criteria.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. First hire seniors with the smallest salaries until we can't hire any more
2. Then use the remaining budget to hire juniors with the smallest salaries
3. Return the employee_ids of all hired candidates

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Order candidates by experience and salary

```SQL
WITH OrderedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        -- Prioritize seniors first, then sort by salary
        CASE WHEN experience = 'Senior' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS priority,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS rank_within_exp
    FROM Candidates
    ORDER BY priority, salary
)
```

Explanation: We create a CTE that orders candidates by experience (seniors first) and then by salary (ascending). This setup will help us pick candidates in the correct order.

## Step 2: Calculate running sums and determine who gets hired

```SQL
WITH OrderedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        CASE WHEN experience = 'Senior' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS priority
    FROM Candidates
),
RankedSeniors AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        salary,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM OrderedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
HiredSeniors AS (
    SELECT employee_id, salary
    FROM RankedSeniors
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
RemainingBudget AS (
    SELECT 70000 - COALESCE(SUM(salary), 0) AS budget
    FROM HiredSeniors
),
RankedJuniors AS (
    SELECT
        c.employee_id,
        c.salary,
        SUM(c.salary) OVER (ORDER BY c.salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM OrderedCandidates c
    WHERE c.experience = 'Junior'
),
HiredJuniors AS (
    SELECT rj.employee_id
    FROM RankedJuniors rj, RemainingBudget rb
    WHERE rj.running_total <= rb.budget
)
```

Explanation: We separately rank seniors and juniors by salary, calculate running totals, and determine who gets hired based on the budget constraints.

## Step 3: Combine results and format output

```SQL
WITH OrderedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        experience,
        salary,
        CASE WHEN experience = 'Senior' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS priority
    FROM Candidates
),
RankedSeniors AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        salary,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM OrderedCandidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
),
HiredSeniors AS (
    SELECT employee_id, salary
    FROM RankedSeniors
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
RemainingBudget AS (
    SELECT 70000 - COALESCE(SUM(salary), 0) AS budget
    FROM HiredSeniors
),
RankedJuniors AS (
    SELECT
        c.employee_id,
        c.salary,
        SUM(c.salary) OVER (ORDER BY c.salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM OrderedCandidates c
    WHERE c.experience = 'Junior'
),
HiredJuniors AS (
    SELECT rj.employee_id
    FROM RankedJuniors rj, RemainingBudget rb
    WHERE rj.running_total <= rb.budget
)
SELECT employee_id FROM HiredSeniors
UNION ALL
SELECT employee_id FROM HiredJuniors
```

Explanation: Finally, we combine the IDs of hired seniors and juniors into a single result set.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedSeniors AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        salary,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM Candidates
    WHERE experience = 'Senior'
    ORDER BY salary
),
HiredSeniors AS (
    SELECT employee_id, salary
    FROM RankedSeniors
    WHERE running_total <= 70000
),
RemainingBudget AS (
    SELECT 70000 - COALESCE(SUM(salary), 0) AS budget
    FROM HiredSeniors
),
RankedJuniors AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        salary,
        SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM Candidates
    WHERE experience = 'Junior'
    ORDER BY salary
),
HiredJuniors AS (
    SELECT rj.employee_id
    FROM RankedJuniors rj, RemainingBudget rb
    WHERE rj.running_total <= rb.budget
)
SELECT employee_id FROM HiredSeniors
UNION ALL
SELECT employee_id FROM HiredJuniors
```

This solution works by:

1. Ranking seniors by salary and calculating a running sum
2. Selecting seniors whose running sum is within the budget
3. Calculating the remaining budget after hiring seniors
4. Ranking juniors by salary and calculating a running sum
5. Selecting juniors whose running sum is within the remaining budget
6. Combining the results

For the first example, the solution identifies:

- Seniors hired: IDs 11 and 2 (salaries $16,000 and $20,000, total $36,000)
- Juniors hired: IDs 1 and 9 (salaries $10,000 and $15,000, total $25,000)
- Total spent: $61,000 out of $70,000 budget

For the second example:

- No seniors hired (all have salaries $80,000+)
- Juniors hired: IDs 9, 1, and 4 (salaries $10,000, $25,000, and $30,000, total $65,000)
- Total spent: $65,000 out of $70,000 budget
