Each row of this table contains information about a transaction, including the customer ID, product ID, date, and amount spent.
```

Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| category    | varchar |
| price       | decimal |

product_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about a product, including its category and price.
```

Write a solution to analyze customer purchasing behavior. For **each customer**, calculate:

- The total amount spent.
- The number of transactions.
- The number of **unique** product categories purchased.
- The average amount spent.
- The **most frequently** purchased product category (if there is a tie, choose the one with the most recent transaction).
- A **loyalty score** defined as: (Number of transactions * 10) + (Total amount spent / 100).

Round `total_amount`, `avg_transaction_amount`, and `loyalty_score` to `2` decimal places.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `loyalty_score` _in **descending** order_, _then by_ `customer_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Transactions` table:

```Plain
+----------------+-------------+------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | product_id | transaction_date | amount |
+----------------+-------------+------------+------------------+--------+
| 1              | 101         | 1          | 2023-01-01       | 100.00 |
| 2              | 101         | 2          | 2023-01-15       | 150.00 |
| 3              | 102         | 1          | 2023-01-01       | 100.00 |
| 4              | 102         | 3          | 2023-01-22       | 200.00 |
| 5              | 101         | 3          | 2023-02-10       | 200.00 |
+----------------+-------------+------------+------------------+--------+
```

`Products` table:

```Plain
+------------+----------+--------+
| product_id | category | price  |
+------------+----------+--------+
| 1          | A        | 100.00 |
| 2          | B        | 150.00 |
| 3          | C        | 200.00 |
+------------+----------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| customer_id | total_amount | transaction_count | unique_categories | avg_transaction_amount | top_category | loyalty_score |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
| 101         | 450.00       | 3                 | 3                 | 150.00                 | C            | 34.50         |
| 102         | 300.00       | 2                 | 2                 | 150.00                 | C            | 23.00         |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------------+--------------+---------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For customer 101:
    - Total amount spent: 100.00 + 150.00 + 200.00 = 450.00
    - Number of transactions: 3
    - Unique categories: A, B, C (3 categories)
    - Average transaction amount: 450.00 / 3 = 150.00
    - Top category: C (Customer 101 made 1 purchase each in categories  
        A, B, and C. Since the count is the same for all categories, we choose  
        the most recent transaction, which is category C on 2023-02-10)  
        
    - Loyalty score: (3 * 10) + (450.00 / 100) = 34.50
- For customer 102:
    - Total amount spent: 100.00 + 200.00 = 300.00
    - Number of transactions: 2
    - Unique categories: A, C (2 categories)
    - Average transaction amount: 300.00 / 2 = 150.00
    - Top category: C (Customer 102 made 1 purchase each in categories A and C. Since the count is the same for both categories, we choose the  
        most recent transaction, which is category C on 2023-01-22)  
        
    - Loyalty score: (2 * 10) + (300.00 / 100) = 23.00

**Note:** The output is ordered by loyalty_score in descending order, then by customer_id in ascending order.

  

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to calculate the following for each customer:

1. **Total amount spent**.
2. **Number of transactions**.
3. **Number of unique product categories purchased**.
4. **Average amount spent**.
5. **Most frequently purchased product category** (if tied, choose the most recent).
6. **Loyalty score**: `(Number of transactions * 10) + (Total amount spent / 100)`.

**Key Points:**

- Use aggregations to calculate totals, counts, and averages.
- Use window functions or subqueries to determine the most frequent category.
- Combine data from `Transactions` and `Products` tables.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Basic Metrics**

First, calculate the total amount spent, number of transactions, and unique categories for each customer.

```SQL
WITH CustomerMetrics AS (
    SELECT
        t.customer_id,
        SUM(t.amount) AS total_amount,
        COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS transaction_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.category) AS unique_categories
    FROM
        Transactions t
    JOIN
        Products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY
        t.customer_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**SUM(t.amount)**`: Calculates the total amount spent by each customer.
- `**COUNT(t.transaction_id)**`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer.
- `**COUNT(DISTINCT p.category)**`: Counts the unique product categories purchased by each customer.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Average Transaction Amount**

Next, calculate the average transaction amount for each customer.

```SQL
, AvgTransaction AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        ROUND(total_amount / transaction_count, 2) AS avg_transaction_amount
    FROM
        CustomerMetrics
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ROUND(total_amount / transaction_count, 2)**`: Computes the average amount spent per transaction, rounded to 2 decimal places.

---

### **Step 4: Determine the Most Frequent Product Category**

Now, determine the most frequently purchased product category for each customer. If there’s a tie, choose the one with the most recent transaction.

```SQL
, TopCategory AS (
    SELECT
        t.customer_id,
        p.category AS top_category,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY t.customer_id
            ORDER BY
                COUNT(t.transaction_id) DESC,
                MAX(t.transaction_date) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM
        Transactions t
    JOIN
        Products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY
        t.customer_id, p.category
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)**`: Assigns a rank to each category based on:
    - The count of transactions (`COUNT(t.transaction_id)`).
    - The most recent transaction date (`MAX(t.transaction_date)`).
- `**PARTITION BY t.customer_id**`: Resets ranking for each customer.
- `**ORDER BY COUNT(...) DESC, MAX(...) DESC**`: Prioritizes categories with the highest count and most recent transaction.

---

### **Step 5: Calculate Loyalty Score**

Finally, calculate the loyalty score for each customer.

```SQL
, LoyaltyScore AS (
    SELECT
        cm.customer_id,
        ROUND((cm.transaction_count * 10) + (cm.total_amount / 100), 2) AS loyalty_score
    FROM
        CustomerMetrics cm
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ROUND((transaction_count * 10) + (total_amount / 100), 2)**`: Computes the loyalty score, rounded to 2 decimal places.

---

### **Step 6: Combine All Metrics**

Combine all the metrics into a single result table.

```SQL
SELECT
    cm.customer_id,
    ROUND(cm.total_amount, 2) AS total_amount,
    cm.transaction_count,
    cm.unique_categories,
    at.avg_transaction_amount,
    tc.top_category,
    ls.loyalty_score
FROM
    CustomerMetrics cm
JOIN
    AvgTransaction at ON cm.customer_id = at.customer_id
LEFT JOIN
    TopCategory tc ON cm.customer_id = tc.customer_id AND tc.rn = 1
JOIN
    LoyaltyScore ls ON cm.customer_id = ls.customer_id
ORDER BY
    ls.loyalty_score DESC, cm.customer_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**LEFT JOIN TopCategory**`: Ensures all customers are included, even if there’s no top category (e.g., no transactions).
- `**ORDER BY loyalty_score DESC, customer_id ASC**`: Orders the result by loyalty score in descending order, then by customer ID in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH CustomerMetrics AS (
    SELECT
        t.customer_id,
        SUM(t.amount) AS total_amount,
        COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS transaction_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.category) AS unique_categories
    FROM
        Transactions t
    JOIN
        Products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY
        t.customer_id
),
AvgTransaction AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        ROUND(total_amount / transaction_count, 2) AS avg_transaction_amount
    FROM
        CustomerMetrics
),
TopCategory AS (
    SELECT
        t.customer_id,
        p.category AS top_category,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY t.customer_id
            ORDER BY
                COUNT(t.transaction_id) DESC,
                MAX(t.transaction_date) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM
        Transactions t
    JOIN
        Products p ON t.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY
        t.customer_id, p.category
),
LoyaltyScore AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        ROUND((transaction_count * 10) + (total_amount / 100), 2) AS loyalty_score
    FROM
        CustomerMetrics
)
SELECT
    cm.customer_id,
    ROUND(cm.total_amount, 2) AS total_amount,
    cm.transaction_count,
    cm.unique_categories,
    at.avg_transaction_amount,
    tc.top_category,
    ls.loyalty_score
FROM
    CustomerMetrics cm
JOIN
    AvgTransaction at ON cm.customer_id = at.customer_id
LEFT JOIN
    TopCategory tc ON cm.customer_id = tc.customer_id AND tc.rn = 1
JOIN
    LoyaltyScore ls ON cm.customer_id = ls.customer_id
ORDER BY
    ls.loyalty_score DESC, cm.customer_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Aggregations**: Calculate totals, counts, and averages.
3. **Window Functions**: Determine the most frequent category.
4. **Loyalty Score**: Compute the score based on transactions and total amount.
5. **Final Join**: Combine all metrics into a single result table.
6. **Ordering**: Sort the result by loyalty score and customer ID.

This query returns the desired output, analyzing customer purchasing behavior as specified.
