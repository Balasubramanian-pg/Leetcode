Table: `Products`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| product_id       | int     |
| product_name     | varchar |
| product_category | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains data about the company's products.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| unit          | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Products table.
unit is the number of products ordered in order_date.
```

Write a solution to get the names of products that have at least `100` units ordered in **February 2020** and their amount.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.
```

# Finding Products with At Least 100 Units Ordered in February 2020

To solve this problem, I need to identify products that had at least 100 units ordered during February 2020 and report their total units ordered. This requires:

1. Filtering orders from February 2020
2. Summing units by product
3. Filtering products with ≥100 units
4. Joining with Products table to get names

## Approach

1. **Filter February 2020 Orders**: Select orders where order_date is between 2020-02-01 and 2020-02-29
2. **Sum Units by Product**: Calculate total units ordered for each product in this period
3. **Apply Minimum Threshold**: Only include products with ≥100 total units
4. **Join with Products**: Get the product names for the qualifying products
5. **Select Output Columns**: Return product_name and total units

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    SUM(o.unit) AS unit
FROM
    Orders o
JOIN
    Products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE
    o.order_date BETWEEN '2020-02-01' AND '2020-02-29'
GROUP BY
    p.product_id, p.product_name
HAVING
    SUM(o.unit) >= 100;
```

## Explanation

- The WHERE clause filters for orders in February 2020 (leap year safe with BETWEEN)
- JOIN connects orders with product information
- GROUP BY and SUM(unit) calculate total units per product
- HAVING filters for products meeting the 100-unit threshold
- In the example:
    - Product 1 (Leetcode Solutions): 60 + 70 = 130 units
    - Product 5 (Leetcode Kit): 50 + 50 = 100 units
    - Other products either didn't reach 100 units or weren't ordered in February

This solution efficiently combines filtering, aggregation, and joining operations to produce the required results.
