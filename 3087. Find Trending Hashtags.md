+-------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains user_id, tweet_id, tweet_date and tweet.
```

Write a solution to find the **top** `3` trending **hashtags** in **February** `2024`. Each tweet only contains one hashtag.

Return _the result table orderd by count of hashtag, hashtag in_ **descending** _order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

Tweets table:

```Plain
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
| user_id | tweet_id | tweet                                        | tweet_date |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
| 135     | 13       | Enjoying a great start to the day! \#HappyDay | 2024-02-01 |
| 136     | 14       | Another \#HappyDay with good vibes!           | 2024-02-03 |
| 137     | 15       | Productivity peaks! \#WorkLife                | 2024-02-04 |
| 138     | 16       | Exploring new tech frontiers. \#TechLife      | 2024-02-04 |
| 139     | 17       | Gratitude for today's moments. \#HappyDay     | 2024-02-05 |
| 140     | 18       | Innovation drives us. \#TechLife              | 2024-02-07 |
| 141     | 19       | Connecting with nature's serenity. \#Nature   | 2024-02-09 |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------+--------------+
| hashtag   | hashtag_count|
+-----------+--------------+
| \#HappyDay | 3            |
| \#TechLife | 2            |
| \#WorkLife | 1            |
+-----------+--------------+

```

**Explanation:**

- **\#HappyDay:** Appeared in tweet IDs 13, 14, and 17, with a total count of 3 mentions.
- **\#TechLife:** Appeared in tweet IDs 16 and 18, with a total count of 2 mentions.
- **\#WorkLife:** Appeared in tweet ID 15, with a total count of 1 mention.

**Note:** Output table is sorted in descending order by hashtag_count and hashtag respectively.

# Solution

To find the top 3 trending hashtags in February 2024, we need to:

1. Extract the hashtag from each tweet.
2. Filter the tweets to only include those from February 2024.
3. Count the occurrences of each hashtag.
4. Sort the hashtags by their count in descending order and by the hashtag alphabetically in case of ties.
5. Return the top 3 trending hashtags.

### **Steps:**

1. **Extract Hashtags**: Use string functions to extract the hashtag from the `tweet` column.
2. **Filter by Date**: Filter the rows to only include tweets from February 2024.
3. **Count Hashtags**: Group the results by the extracted hashtag and count their occurrences.
4. **Order Results**: Sort the hashtags first by the count of appearances in descending order and then alphabetically by the hashtag in case of ties.
5. **Limit the Results**: Return only the top 3 hashtags.

### **SQL Query**:

```SQL
WITH Hashtags AS (
    SELECT
        -- Extract hashtag from tweet text
        SUBSTRING(tweet, LOCATE('#', tweet), LENGTH(tweet)) AS hashtag
    FROM Tweets
    WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-29'  -- Filter for February 2024
)

SELECT hashtag,COUNT(*) AS hashtag_count
FROM Hashtags
GROUP BY hashtag
ORDER BY hashtag_count DESC, hashtag
LIMIT 3;  -- Return only the top 3 hashtags
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Extracting the Hashtag**:
    - The `SUBSTRING(tweet, LOCATE('#', tweet), LENGTH(tweet))` function extracts the part of the tweet starting from the `#` symbol to the end of the string, effectively isolating the hashtag.
2. **Filtering by Date**:
    - The `WHERE` clause filters the tweets to include only those from February 2024 (using the `BETWEEN` operator).
3. **Grouping and Counting**:
    - The `GROUP BY hashtag` groups the tweets by each hashtag, and `COUNT(*)` counts how many times each hashtag appears.
4. **Sorting and Limiting**:
    - `ORDER BY hashtag_count DESC, hashtag` sorts the results in descending order by the count of appearances, and alphabetically by the hashtag in case of ties.
    - `LIMIT 3` ensures that only the top 3 hashtags are returned.

### **Example Walkthrough**:

Given the input:

```Plain
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
| user_id | tweet_id | tweet                                        | tweet_date |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
| 135     | 13       | Enjoying a great start to the day! \#HappyDay | 2024-02-01 |
| 136     | 14       | Another \#HappyDay with good vibes!           | 2024-02-03 |
| 137     | 15       | Productivity peaks! \#WorkLife                | 2024-02-04 |
| 138     | 16       | Exploring new tech frontiers. \#TechLife      | 2024-02-04 |
| 139     | 17       | Gratitude for today's moments. \#HappyDay     | 2024-02-05 |
| 140     | 18       | Innovation drives us. \#TechLife              | 2024-02-07 |
| 141     | 19       | Connecting with nature's serenity. \#Nature   | 2024-02-09 |
+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+------------+
```

The query will process and return the following result:

```Plain
+-----------+--------------+
| hashtag   | hashtag_count|
+-----------+--------------+
| \#HappyDay | 3            |
| \#TechLife | 2            |
| \#WorkLife | 1            |
+-----------+--------------+
```

This result shows that `#HappyDay` is the most trending hashtag with 3 mentions, followed by `#TechLife` with 2 mentions, and `#WorkLife` with 1 mention. The hashtags are ordered first by count and then alphabetically.
