Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Write a solution to find the **first login date** for each player.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
```

# Finding First Login Date for Each Player

To solve this problem, I need to identify the earliest login date (first_login) for each player in the Activity table. This requires grouping records by player_id and finding the minimum event_date for each group.

## Approach

1. **Group by Player**: Group all records in the Activity table by player_id.
2. **Find Minimum Date**: For each player group, find the minimum event_date, which represents their first login.
3. **Select Result**: Return the player_id along with their first_login date.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    player_id,
    MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM
    Activity
GROUP BY
    player_id;
```

## Explanation

- The query selects the `player_id` and the minimum `event_date` (aliased as `first_login`) from the Activity table.
- The `GROUP BY player_id` clause groups all records by each unique player.
- The `MIN(event_date)` function finds the earliest date for each player group.
- The result shows each player's ID alongside their first login date. In the example:
    - Player 1's first login was 2016-03-01
    - Player 2's first login was 2017-06-25
    - Player 3's first login was 2016-03-02

This approach efficiently finds the first login dates by leveraging SQL's aggregation functions, which are optimized for this type of operation. The GROUP BY clause ensures we get one result per player, and MIN() gives us their earliest login date.
