Table: `Project`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) toEmployee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
```

Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
```

Write a solution to report all the **projects** that have the most employees.

**Solutions**

# SQL Problem: Finding Projects with the Most Employees

Let me solve this problem step by step while explaining my thought process.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Identify what we're looking for and the expected output.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to find projects that have the maximum number of employees working on them. From the tables:  

- Project: Maps employees to projects (many-to-many relationship)
- Employee: Contains employee details

We need to:

1. Count how many employees are working on each project
2. Determine which project(s) have the highest count
3. Return the project_id(s) for those projects

The output is just a list of project_id values for the projects with the most employees.

### 2. Analyzing the Counting Approach

**Procedural step:** Determine how to count employees per project.

**My thought process:**  
Since the Project table already maps employee_id to project_id, we can simply count the number of rows for each project_id using GROUP BY. The Employee table isn't actually needed for this query since we're only concerned with counts, not employee details.  

```SQL
SELECT project_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id;
```

This would give us each project with its employee count. From the example, we should get:

- project_id 1: 3 employees
- project_id 2: 2 employees

### 3. Finding the Maximum Count

**Procedural step:** Determine how to identify projects with the maximum employee count.

**My thought process:**  
There are several ways to find the projects with the maximum count:  

1. **Using a subquery with ALL**: Compare each count against all other counts to find counts that are not less than any other count.
2. **Using window functions**: Rank projects by count and select those with rank 1.
3. **Using a two-step approach**: First find the maximum count, then select projects with that count.

Let me explore these approaches.

### 4. Approach 1: Using ALL with Subquery

**Procedural step:** Implement the ALL operator approach.

```SQL
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) >= ALL (
    SELECT COUNT(employee_id)
    FROM Project
    GROUP BY project_id
);
```

**My thought process:**  
This query:  

1. Groups the Project table by project_id
2. Counts employees for each project
3. Uses HAVING with the ALL operator to compare each count against all other counts
4. Keeps only projects where the count is greater than or equal to ALL other counts

The ALL operator ensures we get projects with the maximum count, even if multiple projects tie for the maximum.

### 5. Approach 2: Using Window Functions

**Procedural step:** Implement the window function approach.

```SQL
WITH ProjectCounts AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC) AS rank_by_count
    FROM Project
    GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT project_id
FROM ProjectCounts
WHERE rank_by_count = 1;
```

**My thought process:**  
This query:  

1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) that:
    - Groups by project_id
    - Counts employees for each project
    - Uses the RANK() window function to rank projects by employee count in descending order
2. Selects projects with rank 1, which are those with the maximum count

RANK() handles ties correctly, so if multiple projects have the same maximum count, they'll all have rank 1.

I'm choosing RANK() over other window functions because:

- RANK() gives the same rank to ties, which is what we want
- ROW_NUMBER() would arbitrarily choose among ties
- DENSE_RANK() would also work here, identical to RANK() since we're only interested in rank 1

### 6. Approach 3: Two-Step Approach

**Procedural step:** Implement the two-step maximum approach.

```SQL
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = (
    SELECT COUNT(employee_id) AS count
    FROM Project
    GROUP BY project_id
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 1
);
```

**My thought process:**  
This query:  

1. Groups by project_id
2. Uses a subquery to find the maximum employee count across all projects
3. Keeps only projects with that maximum count

This approach works but has a potential issue: if there's a tie for the maximum count, LIMIT 1 in the subquery will only return one of them arbitrarily. I need to fix that.

```SQL
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) = (
    SELECT MAX(emp_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(employee_id) AS emp_count
        FROM Project
        GROUP BY project_id
    ) AS counts
);
```

Now it correctly finds the maximum count and compares all projects against that value.

### 7. Comparing the Approaches

**Procedural step:** Evaluate the different solutions.

**My thought process:**  
All three approaches would work, but they have different characteristics:  

1. **ALL with Subquery**:
    - Concise and readable
    - Directly expresses "not less than any other count"
    - May not be optimized well in all database systems
2. **Window Functions**:
    - Modern approach using RANK()
    - Clear separation of counting, ranking, and filtering steps
    - Not supported in older database versions
3. **Two-Step Approach**:
    - More explicit about finding the maximum
    - Requires a nested subquery
    - Less elegant than the other approaches

I prefer the window function approach for its clarity and the explicit ranking step, but the ALL approach is also very elegant.

### 8. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Validate the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's check our solution with the example data:  

From the Project table:

- project_id 1 has employees 1, 2, 3 (count = 3)
- project_id 2 has employees 1, 4 (count = 2)

Using any of our approaches, we should select project_id 1 since it has the highest employee count (3 > 2).

This matches the expected output of just project_id 1.

### 9. Handling Edge Cases

**Procedural step:** Consider potential edge cases.

**My thought process:**  
Some edge cases to consider:  

1. **Multiple projects with the same maximum count**: All our approaches (except the initial two-step approach) correctly handle ties, returning all projects with the maximum count.
2. **NULL values in employee_id**: Since employee_id is part of the primary key, there shouldn't be NULL values. If there were, COUNT(employee_id) would ignore them, but COUNT(*) or COUNT(1) would count them.
3. **Empty table**: If the Project table is empty, our query would return an empty result, which is appropriate.

## Final Solution

After considering all approaches, here's my recommended solution using window functions:

```SQL
WITH ProjectCounts AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC) AS rank_by_count
    FROM Project
    GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT project_id
FROM ProjectCounts
WHERE rank_by_count = 1;
```

This solution:

1. Clearly separates the counting and ranking steps using a CTE
2. Properly handles ties if multiple projects have the same maximum employee count
3. Is efficient and readable
4. Directly addresses the requirement to find projects with the most employees
5. Returns the project_id in the format specified by the problem

Note that I could also use the ALL approach, which is more concise but perhaps slightly less intuitive:

```SQL
SELECT project_id
FROM Project
GROUP BY project_id
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) >= ALL (
    SELECT COUNT(employee_id)
    FROM Project
    GROUP BY project_id
);
```

Both solutions correctly solve the problem of finding projects with the most employees.
