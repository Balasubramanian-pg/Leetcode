Table: `Users`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
name is the name of the user.
```

Table: `Rides`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".
```

Write a solution to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by `travelled_distance` in **descending order**, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their `name` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+
Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Explanation:
Elvis and Lee traveled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveler as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald did not have any rides, the distance traveled by him is 0.
```

# Calculating Distance Traveled by Each User

To solve this problem, I need to calculate the total distance traveled by each user, including users with no rides (who should show 0 distance), and sort the results appropriately.

## Approach

1. **Left Join**: Connect Users with Rides to include all users
2. **Sum Distances**: Calculate total distance for each user (using COALESCE to handle NULLs)
3. **Order Results**: Sort by distance descending, then by name ascending
4. **Include All Users**: Ensure users without rides appear with 0 distance

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    u.name,
    COALESCE(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM
    Users u
LEFT JOIN
    Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY
    u.id, u.name
ORDER BY
    travelled_distance DESC,
    name ASC;
```

## Explanation

- The LEFT JOIN ensures all users are included, even those with no rides
- COALESCE converts NULL sums (for users with no rides) to 0
- GROUP BY combines all rides for each user
- ORDER BY sorts first by distance (descending), then by name (ascending)
- In the example:
    - Elvis and Lee tie at 450 miles, sorted alphabetically
    - Donald shows 0 miles as he has no rides
    - Other users show their total ride distances

This solution efficiently calculates and presents the required information while handling edge cases like users with no rides.
