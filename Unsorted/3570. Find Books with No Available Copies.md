Table: `library_books`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| book_id          | int     |
| title            | varchar |
| author           | varchar |
| genre            | varchar |
| publication_year | int     |
| total_copies     | int     |
+------------------+---------+
book_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a book in the library, including the total number of copies owned by the library.
```

Table: `borrowing_records`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| record_id     | int     |
| book_id       | int     |
| borrower_name | varchar |
| borrow_date   | date    |
| return_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
record_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row represents a borrowing transaction and return_date is NULL if the book is currently borrowed and hasn't been returned yet.
```

Write a solution to find **all books** that are **currently borrowed (not returned)** and have **zero copies available** in the library.

- A book is considered **currently borrowed** if there exists a borrowing record with a **NULL** `return_date`

Return _the result table ordered by current borrowers in **descending** order, then by book title in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

library_books table:

```Plain
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------+------------------+--------------+

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------+------------------+---------------+-----------+------------------+-------------------+
| book_id | title            | author        | genre     | publication_year | current_borrowers |
+---------+------------------+---------------+-----------+------------------+-------------------+
| 1       | The Great Gatsby | F. Scott      | Fiction   | 1925             | 3                 |
| 3       | 1984             | George Orwell | Dystopian | 1949             | 1                 |
+---------+------------------+---------------+-----------+------------------+-------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **The Great Gatsby (book_id = 1):**
    - Total copies: 3
    - Currently borrowed by Alice Smith, Bob Johnson, and Grace Miller (3 borrowers)
    - Available copies: 3 - 3 = 0
    - Included because available_copies = 0
- **1984 (book_id = 3):**
    - Total copies: 1
    - Currently borrowed by David Brown (1 borrower)
    - Available copies: 1 - 1 = 0
    - Included because available_copies = 0
- **Books not included:**
    - To Kill a Mockingbird (book_id = 2): Total copies = 3, current borrowers = 2, available = 1
    - Pride and Prejudice (book_id = 4): Total copies = 2, current borrowers = 1, available = 1
    - The Catcher in the Rye (book_id = 5): Total copies = 1, current borrowers = 0, available = 1
    - Brave New World (book_id = 6): Total copies = 4, current borrowers = 1, available = 3
- **Result ordering:**
    - The Great Gatsby appears first with 3 current borrowers
    - 1984 appears second with 1 current borrower

Output table is ordered by current_borrowers in descending order, then by book_title in ascending order.

# Solution to Find Fully Borrowed Books

To solve this problem, I need to identify books that are currently completely checked out (all copies borrowed) and show them sorted by the number of current borrowers.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
WITH CurrentBorrowers AS (
    SELECT
        b.book_id,
        b.title,
        b.author,
        b.genre,
        b.publication_year,
        b.total_copies,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN r.return_date IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS current_borrowers
    FROM
        library_books b
    LEFT JOIN
        borrowing_records r ON b.book_id = r.book_id
    GROUP BY
        b.book_id, b.title, b.author, b.genre, b.publication_year, b.total_copies
)
SELECT
    book_id,
    title,
    author,
    genre,
    publication_year,
    current_borrowers
FROM
    CurrentBorrowers
WHERE
    current_borrowers = total_copies
ORDER BY
    current_borrowers DESC,
    title ASC;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Create CurrentBorrowers CTE**:
    - Join the library_books table with borrowing_records
    - Count current borrowers (where return_date is NULL) for each book
    - Include all book details and total_copies in the grouping
2. **Filter Fully Borrowed Books**:
    - Select only books where current_borrowers equals total_copies
    - This means all copies are currently checked out
3. **Order Results**:
    - Primary sort by current_borrowers in descending order (most borrowed first)
    - Secondary sort by title in ascending alphabetical order

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data:

- **The Great Gatsby** (book_id=1):
    - Total copies: 3
    - Current borrowers: 3 (Alice, Bob, Grace)
    - Included (3=3)
- **1984** (book_id=3):
    - Total copies: 1
    - Current borrowers: 1 (David)
    - Included (1=1)

Other books are excluded because:

- They have available copies (current_borrowers < total_copies)
- Or aren't currently borrowed at all

The output correctly shows these two books ordered by borrower count then title.

# Simplified Solution for Fully Borrowed Books

Here's a more straightforward approach to find books with all copies currently borrowed:

```SQL
SELECT
    b.book_id,
    b.title,
    b.author,
    b.genre,
    b.publication_year,
    COUNT(r.record_id) AS current_borrowers
FROM
    library_books b
JOIN
    borrowing_records r ON b.book_id = r.book_id AND r.return_date IS NULL
GROUP BY
    b.book_id, b.title, b.author, b.genre, b.publication_year, b.total_copies
HAVING
    COUNT(r.record_id) = b.total_copies
ORDER BY
    current_borrowers DESC,
    title ASC;
```

### Key Simplifications:

1. **Single Query** - Eliminates the CTE by combining everything in one query
2. **Direct JOIN Filter** - Filters for unreturned books right in the JOIN condition
3. **HAVING Clause** - Directly compares borrower count with total copies
4. **Cleaner Counting** - Simply counts record_ids of current borrows

This approach is more concise while achieving exactly the same result as the original solution. The query:

- Joins books with their active borrowings
- Groups by book details
- Only keeps books where borrow count equals total copies
- Orders as specified

It's more efficient as it avoids the intermediate CTE and applies filters earlier in the execution plan.
