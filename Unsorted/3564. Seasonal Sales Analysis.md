```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| sale_id       | int     |
| product_id    | int     |
| sale_date     | date    |
| quantity      | int     |
| price         | decimal |
+---------------+---------+
sale_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a product sale including the product_id, date of sale, quantity sold, and price per unit.
```

Table: `products`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
| category      | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
product_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a product including its name and category.
```

Write a solution to find the most popular product category for each season. The seasons are defined as:

- **Winter**: December, January, February
- **Spring**: March, April, May
- **Summer**: June, July, August
- **Fall**: September, October, November

The **popularity** of a **category** is determined by the **total quantity sold** in that **season**. If there is a **tie**, select the category with the highest **total revenue** (`quantity × price`).

Return _the result table ordered by season in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

## Solution

The overall goal of this query is to:

1. Figure out which season each sale belongs to.
2. Calculate the total quantity of products sold and the total revenue for each product category _within each season_.
3. For each season, identify the single most popular category based on the highest total quantity sold.
4. If there's a tie in quantity, use the highest total revenue to break the tie.
5. Finally, show the season, the most popular category for that season, and its total quantity and revenue.

Here's the query:

```SQL
WITH AggregatedSales AS (
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN MONTH(s.sale_date) IN (12,1,2) THEN 'Winter'
            WHEN MONTH(s.sale_date) IN (3,4,5) THEN 'Spring'
            WHEN MONTH(s.sale_date) IN (6,7,8) THEN 'Summer'
            ELSE 'Fall'        -- Covers 9, 10, 11
        END AS season,         -- 1. Determine the season for each sale
        p.category,            -- 2. Get the product category
        SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity, -- 3. Calculate total quantity sold per category per season
        SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS total_revenue -- 4. Calculate total revenue per category per season
    FROM sales s
    JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id -- Link sales to products to get category
    GROUP BY season, p.category -- Group results to aggregate by season and category
),
RankedSales AS (
    SELECT
        season,
        category,
        total_quantity,
        total_revenue,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY total_quantity DESC, total_revenue DESC) AS rn -- 5. Rank categories within each season
    FROM AggregatedSales
)
SELECT
    season,
    category,
    total_quantity,
    total_revenue
FROM RankedSales
WHERE rn = 1 -- 6. Select only the top-ranked category for each season
ORDER BY season ASC; -- 7. Order the final result by season
```

Let's go through it:

**Part 1:** `**WITH AggregatedSales AS (...)**`

This is the first Common Table Expression (CTE). Think of a CTE as a temporary, named result set that you can refer to within a single SQL statement. It helps make complex queries more readable.

- `**SELECT ... END AS season**`:
    - `CASE WHEN MONTH(s.sale_date) IN (12,1,2) THEN 'Winter' ... ELSE 'Fall' END`: This part looks at the `sale_date` from the `sales` table (`s` is an alias for `sales`).
    - `MONTH(s.sale_date)`: Extracts the month number (1 for January, 12 for December) from the date.
    - The `CASE` statement then assigns a season name ('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall') based on this month number. This becomes a new column called `season`.
- `**p.category**`:
    - This selects the `category` column from the `products` table (`p` is an alias for `products`).
- `**SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity**`:
    - This calculates the sum of all `quantity` sold for a particular group (which we'll define in `GROUP BY`). It names this sum `total_quantity`.
- `**SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS total_revenue**`:
    - For each sale, it first calculates the revenue for that sale (`quantity * price`).
    - Then, it sums up these individual sale revenues for a particular group. This is named `total_revenue`.
- `**FROM sales s JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id**`:
    - This specifies where the data comes from.
    - It starts with the `sales` table (aliased as `s`).
    - `JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id`: It then combines (joins) rows from the `sales` table with rows from the `products` table. The join condition `s.product_id = p.product_id` means it matches sales records to product records where their `product_id` is the same. This is how we get the `category` for each sale.
- `**GROUP BY season, p.category**`:
    - This is crucial. It tells the database to group all the rows that have the same `season` AND the same `p.category` together.
    - The aggregate functions (`SUM()`) then operate on each of these unique groups. So, `SUM(s.quantity)` will give you the total quantity for "Apparel" in "Winter", then for "Tech" in "Winter", then for "Apparel" in "Spring", and so on.
    - Note: `season` here refers to the `season` alias defined in the `SELECT` part of this CTE.

**Output of** `**AggregatedSales**` **CTE (Conceptual):**  
It would look something like this (based on your example):  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|season|category|total quantity|total revenue|
|Winter|Apparel|9|110.00|
|Winter|Kitchen|6|108.00|
|Winter|Tech|3|60.00|
|Winter|Fitness|2|24.00|
|Spring|Kitchen|3|54.00|
|Spring|Tech|1|20.00|
|Spring|Apparel|2|20.00|
|...and so on for Summer and Fall...||||

---

**Part 2:** `**RankedSales AS (...)**`

This is the second CTE. It takes the results from the `AggregatedSales` CTE and adds a rank to each row.

- `**SELECT season, category, total_quantity, total_revenue, ...**`:
    - It selects all the columns from the `AggregatedSales` CTE.
- `**ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY total_quantity DESC, total_revenue DESC) AS rn**`:
    - This is a window function, which performs calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.
    - `ROW_NUMBER()`: Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within its partition.
    - `OVER (...)`: Defines how the "window" or group of rows is determined.
        - `PARTITION BY season`: This divides the data from `AggregatedSales` into partitions, one for each `season`. The `ROW_NUMBER()` will restart counting from 1 for each new season. So, all 'Winter' rows will be ranked among themselves, all 'Spring' rows among themselves, etc.
        - `ORDER BY total_quantity DESC, total_revenue DESC`: Within each `season` partition, this sorts the rows.
            - `total_quantity DESC`: It sorts first by `total_quantity` in descending order (highest quantity gets rank 1).
            - `total_revenue DESC`: If two categories in the same season have the _same_ `total_quantity` (a tie), this part is used as a tie-breaker. The one with the higher `total_revenue` (descending) will get the better (lower) rank.
    - `AS rn`: The calculated rank number is named `rn`.

**Output of** `**RankedSales**` **CTE (Conceptual):**  
Continuing from the  
`AggregatedSales` example:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|season|category|total quantity|total revenue|rn|
|Winter|Apparel|9|110.00|1|
|Winter|Kitchen|6|108.00|2|
|Winter|Tech|3|60.00|3|
|Winter|Fitness|2|24.00|4|
|Spring|Kitchen|3|54.00|1|
|Spring|Apparel|2|20.00|2|
|Spring|Tech|1|20.00|3|
|...and so on...|||||

_(Notice for Spring: Kitchen (qty 3) is rank 1. Apparel (qty 2, rev 20) is rank 2. Tech (qty 1, rev 20) is rank 3. If Apparel and Tech had the same quantity, their revenue would decide their rank order.)_

---

**Part 3: The Final** `**SELECT**` **Statement**

This is the main query that produces the final result.

- `**SELECT season, category, total_quantity, total_revenue**`:
    - It selects the desired columns for the final output.
- `**FROM RankedSales**`:
    - It gets its data from the `RankedSales` CTE (which contains the ranks).
- `**WHERE rn = 1**`:
    - This is the crucial filtering step. It only keeps the rows where the rank (`rn`) is 1. Since we ranked categories _within each season_, this effectively picks out the top-ranked (most popular) category for each season.
- `**ORDER BY season ASC**`:
    - Finally, it sorts the resulting rows alphabetically by `season` in ascending order (Fall, Spring, Summer, Winter).

**Final Output (as per your example):**

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|season|category|total quantity|total revenue|
|Fall|Apparel|10|120.00|
|Spring|Kitchen|3|54.00|
|Summer|Tech|5|100.00|
|Winter|Apparel|9|110.00|
