Table: `Users`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
```

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+
```

# Fixing User Names to Proper Case

To solve this problem, I need to format user names so that only the first character is uppercase and all remaining characters are lowercase. The results should be ordered by user_id.

## Approach

1. **Capitalize First Letter**: Convert the first character of each name to uppercase
2. **Lowercase Remaining Letters**: Convert all other characters to lowercase
3. **Order Results**: Sort the output by user_id

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    CONCAT(
        UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)),
        LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))
    ) AS name
FROM
    Users
ORDER BY
    user_id;
```

## Explanation

1. `LEFT(name, 1)` extracts the first character of the name
2. `UPPER()` converts this first character to uppercase
3. `SUBSTRING(name, 2)` gets the rest of the name starting from the second character
4. `LOWER()` converts these remaining characters to lowercase
5. `CONCAT()` combines the uppercase first letter with the lowercase remainder
6. `ORDER BY user_id` sorts the results as required

For the example:

- "aLice" becomes "A" + "lice" = "Alice"
- "bOB" becomes "B" + "ob" = "Bob"

This solution efficiently transforms the names to proper case while maintaining the original order of records.
