Table: `RequestAccepted`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
```

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 3  | 3   |
+----+-----+
Explanation:
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
```

**Follow up:** In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends. Could you find all these people in this case?

# Solution to Find Person with Most Friends

To solve this problem, I need to identify who has the most friends by considering both sides of friend relationships (both requester and accepter).

## SQL Solution (Basic Problem)

```SQL
WITH FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AllFriends
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT id, num
FROM FriendCounts
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## SQL Solution (Follow-up - Handle Ties)

```SQL
WITH FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
        UNION ALL
        SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
    ) AllFriends
    GROUP BY id
),
MaxFriends AS (
    SELECT MAX(num) AS max_num
    FROM FriendCounts
)
SELECT id, num
FROM FriendCounts
WHERE num = (SELECT max_num FROM MaxFriends)
ORDER BY id;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### Basic Solution:

1. **Combine Both Sides of Relationships**:
    - Use `UNION ALL` to combine all `requester_id` and `accepter_id` values
    - This gives us all friend connections in both directions
2. **Count Friends per Person**:
    - Group by user ID and count occurrences to get friend counts
3. **Find Person with Most Friends**:
    - Order by friend count descending
    - Use `LIMIT 1` to get just the top result (as per problem statement)

### Follow-up Solution (Handling Ties):

1. **Same Friend Counting**:
    - First part identical to basic solution
2. **Find Maximum Friend Count**:
    - Create a CTE to store the maximum friend count value
3. **Return All with Maximum Count**:
    - Filter to only include users with this maximum count
    - Order by ID for consistent results

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data:

- User 1 appears as requester twice (friends with 2 and 3)
- User 2 appears once as requester and once as accepter (friends with 1 and 3)
- User 3 appears twice as accepter and once as requester (friends with 1, 2, and 4)
- User 4 appears once as accepter (friend with 3)

Counts:

- 1: 2 friends
- 2: 2 friends
- 3: 3 friends
- 4: 1 friend

The output correctly shows user 3 with 3 friends.

The follow-up solution would return all users with the maximum count if there were ties (though the problem states there won't be ties in test cases).
