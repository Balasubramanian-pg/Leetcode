**Description**

Table: `Candidate`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
+-------------+----------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the id and the name of a candidate.
```

Table: `Vote`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| candidateId | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is an auto-increment primary key (column with unique values).
candidateId is a foreign key (reference column) to id from the Candidate table.
Each row of this table determines the candidate who got the ith vote in the elections.
```

Write a solution to report the name of the winning candidate (i.e., the candidate who got the largest number of votes).

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one candidate wins** the elections.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidate table:
+----+------+
| id | name |
+----+------+
| 1  | A    |
| 2  | B    |
| 3  | C    |
| 4  | D    |
| 5  | E    |
+----+------+
Vote table:
+----+-------------+
| id | candidateId |
+----+-------------+
| 1  | 2           |
| 2  | 4           |
| 3  | 3           |
| 4  | 2           |
| 5  | 5           |
+----+-------------+
Output:
+------+
| name |
+------+
| B    |
+------+
Explanation:
Candidate B has 2 votes. Candidates C, D, and E have 1 vote each.
The winner is candidate B.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1**

**MySQL**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    Name
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            CandidateId AS id
        FROM Vote
        GROUP BY CandidateId
        ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS t
    INNER JOIN Candidate AS c ON t.id = c.id;
```

**Solution 2**

**MySQL**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name
FROM
    Candidate AS c
    LEFT JOIN Vote AS v ON c.id = v.candidateId
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Approach 1: Subquery with Aggregation**

**Goal**: Identify the candidate with the most votes by first aggregating votes and then joining with the Candidate table.

### Steps:

1. **Aggregate Votes by Candidate**:
    
    - Group the `Vote` table by `candidateId`.
    - Count the number of votes per candidate using `COUNT(id)`.
    - Sort candidates by vote count in descending order and select the top candidate.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        CandidateId AS id
    FROM Vote
    GROUP BY CandidateId
    ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
    
2. **Retrieve Candidate Name**:
    
    - Join the result from Step 1 with the `Candidate` table to fetch the candidate’s name.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        Name
    FROM (
        -- Subquery from Step 1
        SELECT
            CandidateId AS id
        FROM Vote
        GROUP BY CandidateId
        ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS t
    INNER JOIN Candidate AS c ON t.id = c.id;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `GROUP BY CandidateId` groups votes by candidate.
- `ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC` sorts candidates by vote count (highest first).
- `LIMIT 1` selects the top candidate (since the problem guarantees a unique winner).
- Joining with `Candidate` maps the `candidateId` to the candidate’s name.

---

### **Approach 2: Join First, Then Aggregate**

**Goal**: Join the `Candidate` and `Vote` tables first, then aggregate to count votes.

### Steps:

1. **Join Tables**:
    - Perform a `LEFT JOIN` between `Candidate` and `Vote` to link candidates with their votes.
2. **Aggregate and Sort**:
    
    - Group by `candidate.id` to count votes per candidate.
    - Sort by vote count in descending order and select the top candidate.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        name
    FROM
        Candidate AS c
        LEFT JOIN Vote AS v ON c.id = v.candidateId
    GROUP BY c.id
    ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `LEFT JOIN` ensures all candidates are included (even those with zero votes).
- `GROUP BY c.id` groups the joined data by candidate.
- `COUNT(1)` counts the number of votes for each candidate.
- `LIMIT 1` selects the candidate with the highest vote count.

### **Key Differences Between Approaches**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Subquery Approach**|**Join-First Approach**|
|Aggregates votes before joining.|Joins first, then aggregates.|
|Processes smaller data (only `Vote` table) during aggregation.|Processes larger data (joined tables) during aggregation.|
|More efficient for large `Vote` tables.|Simpler syntax but may be slower with many votes.|

---

### **Final Solutions**

### Approach 1: Subquery

```SQL
SELECT
    Name
FROM (
    SELECT
        CandidateId AS id
    FROM Vote
    GROUP BY CandidateId
    ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
    LIMIT 1
) AS t
INNER JOIN Candidate AS c ON t.id = c.id;
```

### Approach 2: Join-First

```SQL
SELECT
    name
FROM
    Candidate AS c
    LEFT JOIN Vote AS v ON c.id = v.candidateId
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

**Explanation of Results**:

- **Example Input**: Candidate B (id=2) has 2 votes, the highest count.
- Both approaches correctly identify B as the winner by counting votes and selecting the top candidate.

### Insert Into

# SQL Insert Statements for Election Database

Here are the SQL commands to create and populate the `Candidate` and `Vote` tables with the provided data:

```SQL
-- Create the Candidate table
CREATE TABLE Candidate (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create the Vote table
CREATE TABLE Vote (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    candidateId INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (candidateId) REFERENCES Candidate(id)
);

-- Insert candidate data
INSERT INTO Candidate (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'A'),
(2, 'B'),
(3, 'C'),
(4, 'D'),
(5, 'E');

-- Insert vote data
INSERT INTO Vote (id, candidateId) VALUES
(1, 2),
(2, 4),
(3, 3),
(4, 2),
(5, 5);
```

## Query to Find the Winning Candidate

```SQL
SELECT c.name
FROM Candidate c
JOIN (
    SELECT candidateId, COUNT(*) as vote_count
    FROM Vote
    GROUP BY candidateId
    ORDER BY vote_count DESC
    LIMIT 1
) v ON c.id = v.candidateId;
```

## Alternative Query (Handling Ties)

If you need to handle cases where multiple candidates might tie for the highest number of votes:

```SQL
WITH VoteCounts AS (
    SELECT candidateId, COUNT(*) as vote_count
    FROM Vote
    GROUP BY candidateId
),
MaxVotes AS (
    SELECT MAX(vote_count) as max_count
    FROM VoteCounts
)
SELECT c.name
FROM Candidate c
JOIN VoteCounts v ON c.id = v.candidateId
JOIN MaxVotes m ON v.vote_count = m.max_count;
```

## Explanation:

1. The `Candidate` table stores candidate IDs and names
2. The `Vote` table records each vote with a reference to the candidate
3. The first query finds the candidate with the most votes by:
    - Counting votes per candidate
    - Sorting by vote count (descending)
    - Taking the top result
4. The alternative query handles ties by:
    - Calculating vote counts for all candidates
    - Finding the maximum vote count
    - Returning all candidates who have that maximum count

The result will show "B" as the winner, matching the example output.
