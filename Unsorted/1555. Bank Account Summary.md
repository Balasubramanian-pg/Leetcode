**Description**

Table: `Users`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| user_id      | int     |
| user_name    | varchar |
| credit       | int     |
+--------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the current credit information for each user.
```

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| trans_id      | int     |
| paid_by       | int     |
| paid_to       | int     |
| amount        | int     |
| transacted_on | date    |
+---------------+---------+
trans_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the transaction in the bank.
User with id (paid_by) transfer money to user with id (paid_to).
```

Leetcode Bank (LCB) helps its coders in making virtual payments. Our bank records all transactions in the table _Transaction_,  
we want to find out the current balance of all users and check whether  
they have breached their credit limit (If their current credit is less  
than  
`0`).

Write a solution to report.

- `user_id`,
- `user_name`,
- `credit`, current balance after performing transactions, and
- `credit_limit_breached`, check credit_limit (`"Yes"` or `"No"`)

Return the result table in **any** order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+
| user_id    | user_name    | credit      |
+------------+--------------+-------------+
| 1          | Moustafa     | 100         |
| 2          | Jonathan     | 200         |
| 3          | Winston      | 10000       |
| 4          | Luis         | 800         |
+------------+--------------+-------------+
Transactions table:
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+
| trans_id   | paid_by    | paid_to    | amount   | transacted_on |
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+
| 1          | 1          | 3          | 400      | 2020-08-01    |
| 2          | 3          | 2          | 500      | 2020-08-02    |
| 3          | 2          | 1          | 200      | 2020-08-03    |
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
| user_id    | user_name  | credit     | credit_limit_breached |
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
| 1          | Moustafa   | -100       | Yes                   |
| 2          | Jonathan   | 500        | No                    |
| 3          | Winston    | 9900       | No                    |
| 4          | Luis       | 800        | No                    |
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
Explanation:
Moustafa paid $400 on "2020-08-01" and received $200 on "2020-08-03", credit (100 -400 +200) = -$100
Jonathan received $500 on "2020-08-02" and paid $200 on "2020-08-08", credit (200 +500 -200) = $500
Winston received $400 on "2020-08-01" and paid $500 on "2020-08-03", credit (10000 +400 -500) = $9990
Luis did not received any transfer, credit = $800
```

I'll solve this SQL problem to calculate users' current balances and check if they've breached their credit limits.

This problem requires us to:

1. Start with each user's initial credit amount
2. Add/subtract all transactions they were involved in
3. Check if the final credit balance is negative

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.user_name,
    u.credit + IFNULL(SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN u.user_id = t.paid_by THEN -t.amount
            WHEN u.user_id = t.paid_to THEN t.amount
            ELSE 0
        END
    ), 0) AS credit,
    CASE
        WHEN u.credit + IFNULL(SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN u.user_id = t.paid_by THEN -t.amount
                WHEN u.user_id = t.paid_to THEN t.amount
                ELSE 0
            END
        ), 0) < 0 THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS credit_limit_breached
FROM
    Users u
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions t ON u.user_id = t.paid_by OR u.user_id = t.paid_to
GROUP BY
    u.user_id, u.user_name, u.credit
```

Let me explain how this works:

1. We start with all users from the `Users` table
2. We use a `LEFT JOIN` to include all transactions where the user either paid money or received money
3. For each user, we calculate their balance changes:
    - When `user_id = paid_by`, we subtract the amount (money sent)
    - When `user_id = paid_to`, we add the amount (money received)
4. We add these changes to the initial credit using `u.credit + SUM(...)`
5. We use `IFNULL` to handle users with no transactions
6. For `credit_limit_breached`, we check if the final credit is negative

The solution handles all scenarios including:

- Users who only sent money
- Users who only received money
- Users who both sent and received money
- Users who had no transactions at all

The output matches the expected result, showing that Moustafa has breached his credit limit with -100 credit, while all other users have positive balances.
