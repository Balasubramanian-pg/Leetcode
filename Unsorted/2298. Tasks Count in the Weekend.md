**Description**

Table: `Tasks`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| task_id     | int  |
| assignee_id | int  |
| submit_date | date |
+-------------+------+
task_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a task, the id of the assignee, and the submission date.
```

Write a solution to report:

- the number of tasks that were submitted during the weekend (Saturday, Sunday) as `weekend_cnt`, and
- the number of tasks that were submitted during the working days as `working_cnt`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Tasks table:
+---------+-------------+-------------+
| task_id | assignee_id | submit_date |
+---------+-------------+-------------+
| 1       | 1           | 2022-06-13  |
| 2       | 6           | 2022-06-14  |
| 3       | 6           | 2022-06-15  |
| 4       | 3           | 2022-06-18  |
| 5       | 5           | 2022-06-19  |
| 6       | 7           | 2022-06-19  |
+---------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+
| weekend_cnt | working_cnt |
+-------------+-------------+
| 3           | 3           |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation:
Task 1 was submitted on Monday.
Task 2 was submitted on Tuesday.
Task 3 was submitted on Wednesday.
Task 4 was submitted on Saturday.
Task 5 was submitted on Sunday.
Task 6 was submitted on Sunday.
3 tasks were submitted during the weekend.
3 tasks were submitted during the working days.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to count tasks based on whether they were submitted on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) or working days (Monday through Friday). We need to:

1. Determine which day of the week each submission date falls on
2. Count tasks submitted on weekends
3. Count tasks submitted on working days

## Step 1: Find which day of the week each submission date is

```SQL
SELECT task_id, DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) AS day_of_week
FROM Tasks
```

Explanation: We use the DAYOFWEEK function to determine the day of the week for each submission date. In MySQL, DAYOFWEEK returns 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, and so on through 7 for Saturday.

## Step 2: Identify weekend vs working day submissions

```SQL
SELECT
    task_id,
    CASE
        WHEN DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 'weekend'
        ELSE 'working_day'
    END AS day_type
FROM Tasks
```

Explanation: We use a CASE statement to categorize each submission as either 'weekend' (when day_of_week is 1 or 7) or 'working_day' (for all other values).

## Step 3: Count tasks in each category

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS weekend_cnt,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) NOT IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS working_cnt
FROM Tasks
```

Explanation: We use SUM with CASE statements to count the number of tasks in each category. For weekend_cnt, we count tasks where day_of_week is 1 or 7. For working_cnt, we count tasks where day_of_week is not 1 or 7.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS weekend_cnt,
    SUM(CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(submit_date) NOT IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS working_cnt
FROM Tasks
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Uses DAYOFWEEK to determine the day of the week for each submission date
2. Uses SUM with CASE statements to count tasks in each category
3. Returns two columns: weekend_cnt and working_cnt

Looking at the example data:

- Tasks 1, 2, and 3 were submitted on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively (working days)
- Tasks 4, 5, and 6 were submitted on Saturday and Sunday (weekend days)
- So we get weekend_cnt = 3 and working_cnt = 3

This matches the expected output.
