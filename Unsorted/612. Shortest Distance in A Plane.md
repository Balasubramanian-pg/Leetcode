**Description**

Table: `Point2D`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
+-------------+------+
(x, y) is the primary key column (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-Y plane.
```

The distance between two points `p1(x1, y1)` and `p2(x2, y2)` is `sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2)`.

Write a solution to report the shortest distance between any two points from the `Point2D` table. Round the distance to **two decimal points**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Point2D table:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
+----+----+
Output:
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1.00     |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1, -1) to (-1, 2).
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1**

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)), 2) AS shortest
FROM
    Point2D AS p1
    JOIN Point2D AS p2 ON p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 1;
```

  

To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest distance between any two points in a 2D plane given in the Point2D table. The solution involves calculating the Euclidean distance between all pairs of distinct points and identifying the minimum distance.

### Approach

1. **Self-Join for Pairs**: We self-join the Point2D table to generate all possible pairs of distinct points. This is done by ensuring that the coordinates (x, y) of the two points in each pair are not identical.
2. **Calculate Euclidean Distance**: For each pair of points, we compute the Euclidean distance using the formula \( \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \).
3. **Order and Limit**: We sort the computed distances in ascending order and select the smallest distance, rounding the result to two decimal places.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(POW(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + POW(p1.y - p2.y, 2)), 2) AS shortest
FROM Point2D p1
JOIN Point2D p2 ON p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y
ORDER BY shortest
LIMIT 1;
```

### Explanation

1. **Self-Join**: The table is joined with itself to create pairs of points where each point is compared with every other point except itself. This is achieved by the condition `p1.x != p2.x OR p1.y != p2.y`, ensuring we only consider distinct points.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each pair, the Euclidean distance is computed using the formula. The `POW` function calculates the squared differences, and `SQRT` gives the square root of the sum, which is the distance.
3. **Sorting and Selection**: By ordering the results by the computed distance in ascending order and limiting the result to the first row, we efficiently obtain the shortest distance. The `ROUND` function ensures the result is formatted to two decimal places.

This approach efficiently computes the shortest distance by considering all valid pairs and leveraging SQL's sorting and limiting capabilities to find the minimum distance.
