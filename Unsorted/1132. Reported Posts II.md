**Description**

Table: `Actions`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    |
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM (category) type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action, such as a reason for the report or a type of reaction.
```

Table: `Removals`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| post_id       | int     |
| remove_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
post_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row in this table indicates that some post was removed due to being reported or as a result of an admin review.
```

Write a solution to find the average daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+
Output:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
Explanation:
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts were removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
```

# SQL Challenge: Calculating Average Daily Spam Removal Percentage

This problem requires us to calculate the average daily percentage of posts that were removed after being reported as spam. Let's break this down step by step to develop a comprehensive solution.

## Understanding the Problem

Before writing any SQL, I'll analyze what we need to calculate:

1. For each day, we need to find posts that were reported as spam
2. For those spam-reported posts, determine what percentage were eventually removed
3. Calculate the average of these daily percentages

The important points to note:

- We only care about posts reported as "spam" (not other reasons like "racism")
- A post counts as "removed" if it appears in the Removals table (regardless of removal date)
- We're calculating percentages per day, then averaging those percentages
- The final result should be rounded to 2 decimal places

## Step-by-Step Solution Development

### Step 1: Identify Spam Reports by Day

First, let's find all posts reported as spam on each day:

```SQL
SELECT
    action_date,
    post_id
FROM Actions
WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam'
```

For our example data, this gives us:

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| action_date | post_id |
+-------------+---------+
| 2019-07-04  | 2       |
| 2019-07-04  | 4       |
| 2019-07-02  | 3       |
+-------------+---------+
```

### Step 2: Calculate Daily Spam Removal Percentage

For each day, we need to:

1. Count the total number of distinct posts reported as spam
2. Count how many of these posts were eventually removed
3. Calculate the percentage

```SQL
WITH SpamReports AS (
    SELECT
        action_date,
        post_id
    FROM Actions
    WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam'
)

SELECT
    sr.action_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sr.post_id) AS spam_reported,
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.post_id) AS spam_removed,
    (COUNT(DISTINCT r.post_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT sr.post_id)) AS daily_percent
FROM
    SpamReports sr
    LEFT JOIN Removals r ON sr.post_id = r.post_id
GROUP BY
    sr.action_date
```

From our example data, this would yield:

```Plain
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------------+
| action_date | spam_reported | spam_removed | daily_percent |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------------+
| 2019-07-02  | 1             | 1           | 100.00        |
| 2019-07-04  | 2             | 1           | 50.00         |
+-------------+---------------+-------------+---------------+
```

### Step 3: Calculate Average of Daily Percentages

Finally, we average these daily percentages:

```SQL
WITH DailyPercentages AS (
    SELECT
        sr.action_date,
        (COUNT(DISTINCT r.post_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT sr.post_id)) AS daily_percent
    FROM
        (SELECT action_date, post_id FROM Actions WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam') sr
        LEFT JOIN Removals r ON sr.post_id = r.post_id
    GROUP BY
        sr.action_date
)

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(daily_percent), 2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM
    DailyPercentages
```

For our example, this gives: (100.00 + 50.00) / 2 = 75.00

## Optimized Complete Solution

Let's put it all together with some optimizations:

```SQL
WITH SpamReportsByDay AS (
    SELECT
        action_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) AS spam_reported_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN post_id IN (SELECT post_id FROM Removals) THEN post_id END) AS spam_removed_count
    FROM Actions
    WHERE action = 'report' AND extra = 'spam'
    GROUP BY action_date
),
DailyPercentages AS (
    SELECT
        (spam_removed_count * 100.0 / spam_reported_count) AS daily_percent
    FROM SpamReportsByDay
)

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(daily_percent), 2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM DailyPercentages
```

However, this approach with subquery in the CASE statement might not be optimal for large datasets. Let's improve it:

```SQL
WITH SpamReports AS (
    SELECT
        a.action_date,
        a.post_id,
        CASE WHEN r.post_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS was_removed
    FROM
        Actions a
        LEFT JOIN Removals r ON a.post_id = r.post_id
    WHERE
        a.action = 'report' AND a.extra = 'spam'
),
DailyPercentages AS (
    SELECT
        action_date,
        (SUM(was_removed) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS daily_percent
    FROM SpamReports
    GROUP BY action_date
)

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(daily_percent), 2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM DailyPercentages
```

## Alternative Solution: Using DISTINCT Counts with JOIN

This approach is cleaner and likely more performant:

```SQL
WITH DailyPercentages AS (
    SELECT
        a.action_date,
        (COUNT(DISTINCT r.post_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT a.post_id)) AS daily_percent
    FROM
        Actions a
        LEFT JOIN Removals r ON a.post_id = r.post_id
    WHERE
        a.action = 'report' AND a.extra = 'spam'
    GROUP BY
        a.action_date
)

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(daily_percent), 2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM DailyPercentages
```

This solution:

1. Joins Actions and Removals directly
2. Filters for spam reports
3. Calculates the percentage using COUNT(DISTINCT) to handle potential duplicate rows
4. Averages the daily percentages and rounds to 2 decimal places

## Execution Walkthrough with Example Data

Let's trace through our final solution with the example data:

1. Initial query to find spam reports and whether they were removed:

```Plain
+-------------+---------+------------+
| action_date | post_id | was_removed|
+-------------+---------+------------+
| 2019-07-02  | 3       | 1          | (removed)
| 2019-07-04  | 2       | 1          | (removed)
| 2019-07-04  | 4       | 0          | (not removed)
+-------------+---------+------------+
```

1. Calculate daily percentages:

```Plain
+-------------+---------------+
| action_date | daily_percent |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2019-07-02  | 100.00        | (1/1 * 100)
| 2019-07-04  | 50.00         | (1/2 * 100)
+-------------+---------------+
```

1. Final average:

```Plain
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 | ((100 + 50) / 2)
+-----------------------+
```

## Edge Case Analysis

Let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **No spam reports**: If there are no spam reports at all, the query would return NULL or no rows.
    - Resolution: We can handle this with COALESCE or IFNULL to return 0.
2. **Spam reports with no removals**: If posts are reported as spam but none are removed, the percentage would be 0.
    - Our solution handles this correctly.
3. **Division by zero**: If we try to calculate percentages for days with no spam reports.
    - Our WHERE clause prevents this by only including days with spam reports.
4. **Duplicate reports**: Multiple users might report the same post as spam on the same day.
    - Our use of COUNT(DISTINCT post_id) handles this correctly.

## Final Optimal Solution

```SQL
WITH DailySpamStats AS (
    SELECT
        a.action_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT a.post_id) AS total_spam_reports,
        COUNT(DISTINCT r.post_id) AS removed_spam_reports
    FROM
        Actions a
        LEFT JOIN Removals r ON a.post_id = r.post_id
    WHERE
        a.action = 'report' AND a.extra = 'spam'
    GROUP BY
        a.action_date
),
DailyPercentages AS (
    SELECT
        (removed_spam_reports * 100.0 / total_spam_reports) AS daily_percent
    FROM
        DailySpamStats
)

SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(daily_percent), 2) AS average_daily_percent
FROM
    DailyPercentages
```

This solution:

1. First calculates daily statistics for spam reports and removals
2. Then calculates the percentage for each day
3. Finally computes the average of these percentages

The approach is clean, efficient, and handles all the requirements and edge cases of the problem.
