**Description**

Table: `Activity`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

Write a solution to report for each player and date, how many games played **so far** by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 1         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
| 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
| 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
| 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
+-----------+------------+---------------------+
Explanation:
For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
```

**Solutions**

### **Approach 1: Window Function (**`**SUM() OVER()**`**)**

**Goal**: Calculate the cumulative sum of `games_played` for each player up to each event date.

### Steps:

1. **Use a Window Function**:
    
    - Partition the data by `player_id` to group each player’s activity.
    - Order the partitions by `event_date` to ensure chronological processing.
    - Use `SUM(games_played) OVER(...)` to compute the running total of games played.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        SUM(games_played) OVER (
            PARTITION BY player_id
            ORDER BY event_date
        ) AS games_played_so_far
    FROM Activity;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `PARTITION BY player_id` processes each player’s data separately.
- `ORDER BY event_date` ensures the summation occurs in chronological order.
- The window function defaults to `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`, summing all previous rows for the player up to the current date.

---

### **Approach 2: Self-Join + Group By**

**Goal**: Calculate the cumulative sum by joining the table with itself for all dates up to the current date.

### Steps:

1. **Self-Join the Table**:
    - Join `Activity` (aliased as `t1`) with itself (aliased as `t2`) on matching `player_id` and `t1.event_date >= t2.event_date`.
    - This ensures all prior or same-day records for a player are included.
2. **Aggregate Results**:
    
    - Group by `t1.player_id` and `t1.event_date` to isolate each unique login event.
    - Sum `t2.games_played` to compute the cumulative total.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        t1.player_id,
        t1.event_date,
        SUM(t2.games_played) AS games_played_so_far
    FROM
        Activity AS t1,
        Activity AS t2
    WHERE
        t1.player_id = t2.player_id
        AND t1.event_date >= t2.event_date
    GROUP BY t1.player_id, t1.event_date;
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- The self-join captures all records for a player up to and including the current `event_date`.
- Grouping by `t1.player_id` and `t1.event_date` ensures each row in the result represents a unique login event.
- `SUM(t2.games_played)` aggregates all games played by the player until the current date.

### **Key Differences Between Approaches**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Window Function Approach**|**Self-Join Approach**|
|Uses built-in window functions for efficiency.|Uses self-join and aggregation.|
|Single table scan, optimal for large datasets.|May involve redundant data scans (O(n²) complexity).|
|Requires SQL support for window functions (e.g., MySQL 8.0+).|Works in all SQL versions.|
|Clean and concise syntax.|More verbose and complex.|

### **Final Solutions**

### Approach 1: Window Function

```SQL
SELECT
    player_id,
    event_date,
    SUM(games_played) OVER (
        PARTITION BY player_id
        ORDER BY event_date
    ) AS games_played_so_far
FROM Activity;
```

### Approach 2: Self-Join

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.player_id,
    t1.event_date,
    SUM(t2.games_played) AS games_played_so_far
FROM
    Activity AS t1,
    Activity AS t2
WHERE
    t1.player_id = t2.player_id
    AND t1.event_date >= t2.event_date
GROUP BY t1.player_id, t1.event_date;
```

- Insert Command To Test Yourself
    
    # SQL Insert Statements for Activity Table
    
    Here are the SQL commands to create and populate the `Activity` table with the provided data:
    
    ```SQL
    -- Create the Activity table
    CREATE TABLE Activity (
        player_id INT,
        device_id INT,
        event_date DATE,
        games_played INT
    );
    
    -- Insert the sample data
    INSERT INTO Activity (player_id, device_id, event_date, games_played) VALUES
    (1, 2, '2016-03-01', 5),
    (1, 2, '2016-05-02', 6),
    (1, 3, '2017-06-25', 1),
    (3, 1, '2016-03-02', 0),
    (3, 4, '2018-07-03', 5);
    ```
    
    ## Query to Calculate Running Total of Games Played
    
    To produce the output showing the cumulative games played by each player over time:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        player_id,
        event_date,
        SUM(games_played) OVER (
            PARTITION BY player_id
            ORDER BY event_date
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS games_played_so_far
    FROM
        Activity
    ORDER BY
        player_id,
        event_date;
    ```
    
    ## Explanation:
    
    1. The `Activity` table is created with columns for player ID, device ID, event date, and games played.
    2. The sample data is inserted with five records showing player login activities.
    3. The query uses a window function with:
        - `PARTITION BY player_id` to group calculations by each player
        - `ORDER BY event_date` to process records in chronological order
        - `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` to calculate a running sum from the first record to the current one
    4. The result shows each player's cumulative games played ("games_played_so_far") at each login event, matching the example output.
