**Description**

Table: `Experiments`

```Plain
+-----------------+------+
| Column Name     | Type |
+-----------------+------+
| experiment_id   | int  |
| platform        | enum |
| experiment_name | enum |
+-----------------+------+
experiment_id is the column with unique values for this table.
platform is an enum (category) type of values ('Android', 'IOS', 'Web').
experiment_name is an enum (category) type of values ('Reading', 'Sports', 'Programming').
This table contains information about the ID of an experiment done with a random person, the platform used to do the experiment, and the name of the experiment.
```

Write a solution to report the **number of experiments**  
done on each of the three platforms for each of the three given  
experiments. Notice that all the pairs of (platform, experiment) should  
be included in the output **including** the pairs with **zero experiments**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Experiments table:
+---------------+----------+-----------------+
| experiment_id | platform | experiment_name |
+---------------+----------+-----------------+
| 4             | IOS      | Programming     |
| 13            | IOS      | Sports          |
| 14            | Android  | Reading         |
| 8             | Web      | Reading         |
| 12            | Web      | Reading         |
| 18            | Web      | Programming     |
+---------------+----------+-----------------+
Output:
+----------+-----------------+-----------------+
| platform | experiment_name | num_experiments |
+----------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Android  | Reading         | 1               |
| Android  | Sports          | 0               |
| Android  | Programming     | 0               |

| IOS      | Sports          | 1               |
| IOS      | Programming     | 1               |
| Web      | Reading         | 2               |
| Web      | Sports          | 0               |

Explanation:
On the platform "Android", we had only one "Reading" experiment.
On the platform "IOS", we had one "Sports" experiment and one "Programming" experiment.
On the platform "Web", we had two "Reading" experiments and one "Programming" experiment.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining each part clearly.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to count experiments across all possible combinations of platforms (Android, IOS, Web) and experiment types (Reading, Sports, Programming). Importantly, we need to include all combinations in the output, even when there are zero experiments for a particular combination.

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Create cross join of all platform-experiment combinations

```SQL
WITH Platforms AS (
    SELECT 'Android' AS platform
    UNION
    SELECT 'IOS'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Web'
),
ExperimentTypes AS (
    SELECT 'Reading' AS experiment_name
    UNION
    SELECT 'Sports'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Programming'
),
AllCombinations AS (
    SELECT p.platform, e.experiment_name
    FROM Platforms p
    CROSS JOIN ExperimentTypes e
)
```

Explanation: First, we create two Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to enumerate all possible platforms and experiment types. Then we use a CROSS JOIN to create every possible combination of platform and experiment type.

## Step 2: Count experiments for each combination

```SQL
WITH Platforms AS (
    SELECT 'Android' AS platform
    UNION
    SELECT 'IOS'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Web'
),
ExperimentTypes AS (
    SELECT 'Reading' AS experiment_name
    UNION
    SELECT 'Sports'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Programming'
),
AllCombinations AS (
    SELECT p.platform, e.experiment_name
    FROM Platforms p
    CROSS JOIN ExperimentTypes e
)
SELECT
    a.platform,
    a.experiment_name,
    COUNT(e.experiment_id) AS num_experiments
FROM AllCombinations a
LEFT JOIN Experiments e
    ON a.platform = e.platform
    AND a.experiment_name = e.experiment_name
GROUP BY a.platform, a.experiment_name
```

Explanation: We LEFT JOIN our AllCombinations table with the actual Experiments table. This ensures we keep all combinations even when there are no matching experiments. We then use COUNT to count the experiments for each combination.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH Platforms AS (
    SELECT 'Android' AS platform
    UNION
    SELECT 'IOS'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Web'
),
ExperimentTypes AS (
    SELECT 'Reading' AS experiment_name
    UNION
    SELECT 'Sports'
    UNION
    SELECT 'Programming'
),
AllCombinations AS (
    SELECT p.platform, e.experiment_name
    FROM Platforms p
    CROSS JOIN ExperimentTypes e
)
SELECT
    a.platform,
    a.experiment_name,
    COUNT(e.experiment_id) AS num_experiments
FROM AllCombinations a
LEFT JOIN Experiments e
    ON a.platform = e.platform
    AND a.experiment_name = e.experiment_name
GROUP BY a.platform, a.experiment_name
```

This query works by:

1. Creating a list of all platforms (Android, IOS, Web)
2. Creating a list of all experiment types (Reading, Sports, Programming)
3. Using a CROSS JOIN to generate all possible combinations
4. LEFT JOINing with the actual Experiments table to find matches
5. Counting experiments for each combination
6. Using GROUP BY to aggregate by platform and experiment name

The solution correctly handles all the requirements:

- It includes all combinations of platform and experiment_name
- It counts the experiments for each combination
- It shows zero for combinations with no experiments

For the example data, it correctly counts:

- Android/Reading: 1 experiment
- Android/Sports: 0 experiments
- Android/Programming: 0 experiments  
    And so on for all 9 possible combinations.
