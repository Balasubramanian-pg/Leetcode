### **Description**

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| id             | int     |U
| country        | varchar |
| state          | enum    |
| amount         | int     |
| trans_date     | date    |
+----------------+---------+
id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an ENUM (category) of type ["approved", "declined"].
```

Table: `Chargebacks`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| trans_id       | int     |FK
| trans_date     | date    |
+----------------+---------+
Chargebacks contains basic information regarding incoming chargebacks from some transactions placed in Transactions table.
trans_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the id column of Transactions table.
Each chargeback corresponds to a transaction made previously even if they were not approved.
```

Write a solution to find for each month and country: the number of approved transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks, and their total amount.

**Note**: In your solution, given the month and country, ignore rows with all zeros.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Transactions table:
+-----+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id  | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
+-----+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| 101 | US      | approved | 1000   | 2019-05-18 |
| 102 | US      | declined | 2000   | 2019-05-19 |
| 103 | US      | approved | 3000   | 2019-06-10 |
| 104 | US      | declined | 4000   | 2019-06-13 |
| 105 | US      | approved | 5000   | 2019-06-15 |
+-----+---------+----------+--------+------------+
Chargebacks table:
+----------+------------+
| trans_id | trans_date |
+----------+------------+
| 102      | 2019-05-29 |
| 101      | 2019-06-30 |
| 105      | 2019-09-18 |
+----------+------------+
Output:
+---------+---------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------------+
| month   | country | approved_count | approved_amount | chargeback_count | chargeback_amount |
+---------+---------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 2019-05 | US      | 1              | 1000            | 1                | 2000              |
| 2019-06 | US      | 2              | 8000            | 1                | 1000              |
| 2019-09 | US      | 0              | 0               | 1                | 5000              |
+---------+---------+----------------+-----------------+------------------+-------------------+
```

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT * FROM Transactions
        UNION
        SELECT id, country, 'chargeback', amount, c.trans_date
        FROM
            Transactions AS t
            JOIN Chargebacks AS c ON t.id = c.trans_id
    )
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    country,
    SUM(state = 'approved') AS approved_count,
    SUM(IF(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_amount,
    SUM(state = 'chargeback') AS chargeback_count,
    SUM(IF(state = 'chargeback', amount, 0)) AS chargeback_amount
FROM T
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING approved_amount OR chargeback_amount;
```

# Understanding Transaction and Chargeback Analysis SQL Solution

This problem requires us to analyze transaction and chargeback data by month and country. Let's break down how the provided SQL solution works and explain its components.

## Problem Requirements

We need to calculate for each month and country:

1. Number of approved transactions
2. Total amount of approved transactions
3. Number of chargebacks
4. Total amount of chargebacks

An important note is that we should ignore rows where all these values are zero.

## Solution Explanation

### **1. Understanding the Problem**

We need to create a monthly report showing:

- Approved transactions (count & total amount)
- Chargebacks (count & total amount)  
    Grouped by month and country, ignoring months with all zeros.  
    

### **2. Solution Approach**

The solution has 3 clear parts:

### **Part A: Gather Approved Transactions**

```SQL
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(trans_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(*) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS approved_amount,
    0 AS chargeback_count,           -- Placeholder for chargeback data
    0 AS chargeback_amount           -- Placeholder for chargeback data
FROM Transactions
WHERE state = 'approved'
GROUP BY month, country
```

- Formats dates as 'YYYY-MM' (month-year)
- Counts/sums only approved transactions
- Adds zero placeholders for chargeback columns

### **Part B: Gather Chargeback Data**

```SQL
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(c.trans_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    t.country,
    0 AS approved_count,             -- Placeholder for approved data
    0 AS approved_amount,            -- Placeholder for approved data
    COUNT(*) AS chargeback_count,
    SUM(t.amount) AS chargeback_amount
FROM Chargebacks c
JOIN Transactions t ON c.trans_id = t.id
GROUP BY month, t.country
```

- Joins chargebacks with original transactions
- Counts/sums chargeback amounts
- Adds zero placeholders for approved transaction columns

### **Part C: Combine and Filter Results**

```SQL
WITH MonthlyStats AS (
    [Part A] UNION ALL [Part B]
)
SELECT
    month, country,
    SUM(approved_count) AS approved_count,
    SUM(approved_amount) AS approved_amount,
    SUM(chargeback_count) AS chargeback_count,
    SUM(chargeback_amount) AS chargeback_amount
FROM MonthlyStats
GROUP BY month, country
HAVING SUM(approved_count) > 0
    OR SUM(approved_amount) > 0
    OR SUM(chargeback_count) > 0
    OR SUM(chargeback_amount) > 0
ORDER BY month, country
```

1. Combines both datasets using `UNION ALL`
2. Groups by month/country to merge rows
3. Filters out completely empty months
4. Sorts the final results

### **Key Points**

- Uses `UNION ALL` to stack two different queries vertically
- Zero placeholders ensure consistent columns
- `HAVING` clause removes "all zero" months
- Works for any date range in the data

This approach cleanly separates the data collection for approved transactions and chargebacks before combining them for the final report.
