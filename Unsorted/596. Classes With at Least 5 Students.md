Table: `Courses`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.
```

Write a solution to find all the classes that have **at least five students**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output:
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation:
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
```

# Finding Classes with At Least Five Students

To solve this problem, I need to identify all classes that have five or more students enrolled. This requires counting the number of students per class and filtering for classes that meet the minimum threshold.

## Approach

1. **Group by Class**: First, group the records in the Courses table by class.
2. **Count Students**: For each class, count the number of distinct students.
3. **Filter by Count**: Only include classes where the student count is 5 or more.
4. **Select Result**: Return just the class names that meet the criteria.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5;
```

## Explanation

- The query starts by selecting the `class` column from the Courses table.
- The `GROUP BY class` clause groups all records by their class name.
- The `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT student) >= 5` condition filters these groups to only include those with 5 or more unique students.
    - Using `DISTINCT` ensures we count each student only once per class, even if there were duplicate entries (though the primary key constraint prevents this in the given table structure).
- In the example, only "Math" has 6 students (A, C, E, G, H, I), so it's the only class returned in the result.

This approach efficiently identifies popular classes by leveraging SQL's grouping and aggregation functions, which are optimized for this type of operation. The HAVING clause is particularly useful for filtering groups based on aggregate conditions.
