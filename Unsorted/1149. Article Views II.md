### **Description**

Table: `Views`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date.
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
```

Write a solution to find all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 3          | 4         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 5    |
| 6    |

# Finding Multi-Article Viewers on the Same Day: SQL Solution

This problem asks us to identify people who viewed more than one article on the same date. Let's break it down step by step.

## Problem Analysis

From the Views table, we need to:

1. Group records by viewer_id and view_date
2. Count distinct articles viewed in each group
3. Filter for viewers who viewed more than one article
4. Return these viewer IDs in ascending order

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: GROUP BY with HAVING

The most straightforward approach is to use GROUP BY with the HAVING clause:

```SQL
SELECT viewer_id AS id
FROM Views
GROUP BY viewer_id, view_date
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1
ORDER BY viewer_id;
```

Let's analyze how this works:

1. We group by both viewer_id and view_date to create groups for each viewer on each date
2. COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) counts unique articles viewed by each viewer on each date
3. The HAVING clause filters for groups with more than one article
4. Finally, we order by viewer_id as required

### Approach 2: Self-Join

An alternative approach using a self-join:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT v1.viewer_id AS id
FROM Views v1
JOIN Views v2 ON v1.viewer_id = v2.viewer_id
               AND v1.view_date = v2.view_date
               AND v1.article_id < v2.article_id
ORDER BY v1.viewer_id;
```

This solution works by:

1. Joining the Views table with itself
2. Matching records with the same viewer_id and view_date
3. Using article_id < article_id to ensure we only match different articles
4. The DISTINCT keyword prevents duplicate viewer_ids
5. Ordering by viewer_id

### Approach 3: Window Function

A more advanced solution using window functions:

```SQL
WITH ArticleCounts AS (
    SELECT
        viewer_id,
        view_date,
        COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) OVER(PARTITION BY viewer_id, view_date) AS article_count
    FROM Views
)

SELECT DISTINCT viewer_id AS id
FROM ArticleCounts
WHERE article_count > 1
ORDER BY viewer_id;
```

This approach:

1. Uses a window function to count distinct articles for each viewer on each date
2. Filters for viewers with multiple articles
3. Returns distinct viewer IDs in order

## Execution Trace

Let's trace through the execution of our first approach using the example data:

1. Group by viewer_id and view_date:
    - (5, 2019-08-01): articles [1, 3]
    - (6, 2019-08-02): articles [1, 2]
    - (7, 2019-08-01): article [2]
    - (1, 2019-07-22): article [4]
    - (4, 2019-07-21): article [3, 3] (duplicate)
2. Count distinct articles in each group:
    - (5, 2019-08-01): 2 articles
    - (6, 2019-08-02): 2 articles
    - (7, 2019-08-01): 1 article
    - (1, 2019-07-22): 1 article
    - (4, 2019-07-21): 1 article (distinct!)
3. Filter for groups with more than one article:
    - (5, 2019-08-01): 2 articles ✓
    - (6, 2019-08-02): 2 articles ✓
4. Order by viewer_id:
    - 5
    - 6

The result matches the expected output.

## Performance Considerations

For large datasets, these approaches have different performance characteristics:

1. GROUP BY approach:
    - Generally efficient with proper indexing
    - Requires one full table scan
    - Recommended index: (viewer_id, view_date, article_id)
2. Self-join approach:
    - May be less efficient for large tables due to the join
    - Could benefit from the same indexing
    - Potentially higher memory usage
3. Window function approach:
    - Modern databases optimize window functions well
    - Similar performance to GROUP BY in many cases
    - May be more readable for complex analyses

## Edge Cases

Our solution correctly handles:

1. Duplicate views of the same article (like user 4 viewing article 3 twice)
2. Authors viewing their own articles (as the problem treats viewer_id independently)
3. Multiple dates for the same viewer (by grouping on date)

## Final Solution

The most efficient and readable solution is:

```SQL
SELECT viewer_id AS id
FROM Views
GROUP BY viewer_id, view_date
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1
ORDER BY viewer_id;
```

This solution is:

- Clear and concise
- Efficient for most database systems
- Handles all the requirements and edge cases
- Easy to understand and maintain

The key insight is using COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) to properly count unique articles, even when there are duplicate views.
