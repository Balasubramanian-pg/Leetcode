```

Leetcode is staffing for multiple data science projects. Write a solution to find the **best candidate** for **each project** based on the following criteria:

1. Candidates must have **all** the skills required for a project.
2. Calculate a **score** for each candidate-project pair as follows:
    - **Start** with `100` points
    - **Add** `10` points for each skill where **proficiency > importance**
    - **Subtract** `5` points for each skill where **proficiency < importance**
    - If the candidate's skill proficiency **equal** to the project's skill importance, the score remains unchanged

Include only the top candidate (highest score) for each project. If there’s a **tie**, choose the candidate with the **lower** `candidate_id`. If there is **no suitable candidate** for a project, **do not return** that project.

Return a result table ordered by `project_id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Candidates` table:

```Plain
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
| candidate_id | skill     | proficiency |
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
| 101          | Python    | 5           |
| 101          | Tableau   | 3           |
| 101          | PostgreSQL| 4           |
| 101          | TensorFlow| 2           |
| 102          | Python    | 4           |
| 102          | Tableau   | 5           |
| 102          | PostgreSQL| 4           |
| 102          | R         | 4           |
| 103          | Python    | 3           |
| 103          | Tableau   | 5           |
| 103          | PostgreSQL| 5           |
| 103          | Spark     | 4           |
+--------------+-----------+-------------+
```

`Projects` table:

```Plain
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| project_id  | skill     | importance |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| 501         | Python    | 4          |
| 501         | Tableau   | 3          |
| 501         | PostgreSQL| 5          |
| 502         | Python    | 3          |
| 502         | Tableau   | 4          |
| 502         | R         | 2          |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+--------------+-------+
| project_id  | candidate_id | score |
+-------------+--------------+-------+
| 501         | 101          | 105   |
| 502         | 102          | 130   |
+-------------+--------------+-------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For Project 501, Candidate 101 has the highest score of 105. All  
    other candidates have the same score but Candidate 101 has the lowest  
    candidate_id among them.  
    
- For Project 502, Candidate 102 has the highest score of 130.

The output table is ordered by project_id in ascending order.

## Solutions

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Match candidates to projects based on required skills.
2. Calculate a score for each candidate-project pair using the given rules.
3. Select the top candidate (highest score) for each project. In case of a tie, choose the candidate with the lower `candidate_id`.
4. Return the result ordered by `project_id` in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Use joins to match candidates to projects based on skills.
- Calculate scores using conditional logic.
- Use window functions to rank candidates for each project and select the top one.

---

### **Step 2: Match Candidates to Projects**

First, match candidates to projects based on required skills.

```SQL
WITH CandidateProjectMatches AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        c.candidate_id,
        p.skill,
        c.proficiency,
        p.importance
    FROM
        Projects p
    JOIN
        Candidates c ON p.skill = c.skill
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CandidateProjectMatches**` **CTE**: Joins `Projects` and `Candidates` tables on the `skill` column to match candidates to projects.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Scores**

Next, calculate the score for each candidate-project pair based on the given rules.

```SQL
, CandidateScores AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        candidate_id,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN proficiency > importance THEN 10
                WHEN proficiency < importance THEN -5
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) + 100 AS score
    FROM
        CandidateProjectMatches
    GROUP BY
        project_id, candidate_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**SUM(CASE ...)**`: Calculates the score adjustment based on proficiency and importance.
    - Adds **10 points** if `proficiency > importance`.
    - Subtracts **5 points** if `proficiency < importance`.
    - Adds **100 base points** to each candidate-project pair.
- `**CandidateScores**` **CTE**: Stores the calculated scores for each candidate-project pair.

---

### **Step 4: Check for Required Skills**

Now, ensure that each candidate has all the required skills for a project.

```SQL
, RequiredSkills AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        c.candidate_id
    FROM
        Projects p
    JOIN
        Candidates c ON p.skill = c.skill
    GROUP BY
        p.project_id, c.candidate_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.skill) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT skill) FROM Projects WHERE project_id = p.project_id)
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**RequiredSkills**` **CTE**: Filters candidates who have all the required skills for a project.
- `**HAVING**` **Clause**: Ensures the candidate has all the skills required for the project.

---

### **Step 5: Rank and Select Top Candidate**

Finally, rank candidates for each project based on their score and select the top candidate.

```SQL
, RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        cs.project_id,
        cs.candidate_id,
        cs.score,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY cs.project_id ORDER BY cs.score DESC, cs.candidate_id ASC) AS rank
    FROM
        CandidateScores cs
    JOIN
        RequiredSkills rs ON cs.project_id = rs.project_id AND cs.candidate_id = rs.candidate_id
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    candidate_id,
    score
FROM
    RankedCandidates
WHERE
    rank = 1
ORDER BY
    project_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**RANK() OVER (...)**`: Assigns a rank to each candidate for a project based on their score. In case of a tie, the candidate with the lower `candidate_id` gets a higher rank.
- `**WHERE rank = 1**`: Selects only the top-ranked candidate for each project.
- `**ORDER BY project_id ASC**`: Orders the result by `project_id` in ascending order.

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH CandidateProjectMatches AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        c.candidate_id,
        p.skill,
        c.proficiency,
        p.importance
    FROM
        Projects p
    JOIN
        Candidates c ON p.skill = c.skill
),
CandidateScores AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        candidate_id,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN proficiency > importance THEN 10
                WHEN proficiency < importance THEN -5
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) + 100 AS score
    FROM
        CandidateProjectMatches
    GROUP BY
        project_id, candidate_id
),
RequiredSkills AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        c.candidate_id
    FROM
        Projects p
    JOIN
        Candidates c ON p.skill = c.skill
    GROUP BY
        p.project_id, c.candidate_id
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.skill) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT skill) FROM Projects WHERE project_id = p.project_id)
),
RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        cs.project_id,
        cs.candidate_id,
        cs.score,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY cs.project_id ORDER BY cs.score DESC, cs.candidate_id ASC) AS rank
    FROM
        CandidateScores cs
    JOIN
        RequiredSkills rs ON cs.project_id = rs.project_id AND cs.candidate_id = rs.candidate_id
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    candidate_id,
    score
FROM
    RankedCandidates
WHERE
    rank = 1
ORDER BY
    project_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Skill Matching**: Matches candidates to projects based on required skills.
3. **Score Calculation**: Computes scores for each candidate-project pair.
4. **Skill Validation**: Ensures candidates have all required skills.
5. **Ranking**: Selects the top candidate for each project.
6. **Ordering**: Returns the result ordered by `project_id`.

This query returns the desired output, listing the best candidate for each project based on the given criteria.
