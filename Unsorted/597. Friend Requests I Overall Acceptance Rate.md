**Description**

Table: `FriendRequest`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| sender_id      | int     |
| send_to_id     | int     |
| request_date   | date    |
+----------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date of the request.
```

Table: `RequestAccepted`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
```

Find the overall acceptance rate of requests, which is the  
number of acceptance divided by the number of requests. Return the  
answer rounded to 2 decimals places.  

**Note that:**

- The accepted requests are not necessarily from the table `friend_request`. In this case, Count the total accepted requests (no matter whether they are in the original requests), and divide it by the number of requests  
    to get the acceptance rate.  
    
- It is possible that a sender sends multiple requests to the same  
    receiver, and a request could be accepted more than once. In this case,  
    the ‘duplicated’ requests or acceptances are only counted once.  
    
- If there are no requests at all, you should return 0.00 as the `accept_rate`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
FriendRequest table:
+-----------+------------+--------------+
| sender_id | send_to_id | request_date |
+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2          | 2016/06/01   |
| 1         | 3          | 2016/06/01   |
| 1         | 4          | 2016/06/01   |
| 2         | 3          | 2016/06/02   |
| 3         | 4          | 2016/06/09   |
+-----------+------------+--------------+
RequestAccepted table:
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/10  |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| accept_rate |
+-------------+
| 0.8         |
+-------------+
Explanation:
There are 4 unique accepted requests, and there are 5 requests in total. So the rate is 0.80.
```

**Follow up:**

- Could you find the acceptance rate for every month?
- Could you find the cumulative acceptance rate for every day?

  

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the overall acceptance rate of friend requests. The acceptance rate is defined as the number of accepted requests divided by the number of friend requests, considering unique requests and acceptances. If there are no friend requests, the acceptance rate should be 0.00.

### Approach

1. **Count Unique Requests**: Calculate the number of unique friend requests from the `FriendRequest` table. Each request is identified by a unique pair of `sender_id` and `send_to_id`.
2. **Count Unique Acceptances**: Calculate the number of unique accepted requests from the `RequestAccepted` table. Each acceptance is identified by a unique pair of `requester_id` and `accepter_id`.
3. **Calculate Acceptance Rate**: Divide the number of unique acceptances by the number of unique requests. If there are no requests, return 0.00. Round the result to two decimal places.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    IF(req.cnt = 0, 0.00, ROUND(acc.cnt / req.cnt, 2)) AS accept_rate
FROM
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) AS cnt FROM FriendRequest) AS req,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) AS cnt FROM RequestAccepted) AS acc;
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Unique Requests**: The subquery `req` counts the number of distinct `(sender_id, send_to_id)` pairs in the `FriendRequest` table. This gives the total number of unique friend requests.
2. **Counting Unique Acceptances**: The subquery `acc` counts the number of distinct `(requester_id, accepter_id)` pairs in the `RequestAccepted` table. This gives the total number of unique accepted requests.
3. **Handling Division**: The main query checks if the number of requests is zero. If it is, the result is 0.00. Otherwise, it calculates the acceptance rate by dividing the number of acceptances by the number of requests and rounds the result to two decimal places.

This approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including scenarios where there are no friend requests or acceptances, ensuring the correct result is returned as specified.
