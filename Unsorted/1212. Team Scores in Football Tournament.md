**Description**

Table: `Teams`

```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
+---------------+----------+
team_id is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.
```

Table: `Matches`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     |
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the column of unique values of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams.
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively.
```

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:

- A team receives **three points** if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).
- A team receives **one point** if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
- A team receives **no points** if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).

Write a solution that selects the `team_id`, `team_name` and `num_points` of each team in the tournament after all described matches.

Return the result table ordered by `num_points` **in decreasing order**. In case of a tie, order the records by `team_id` **in increasing order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Teams table:
+-----------+--------------+

+-----------+--------------+
| 10        | Leetcode FC  |
| 20        | NewYork FC   |
| 30        | Atlanta FC   |
| 40        | Chicago FC   |
| 50        | Toronto FC   |
+-----------+--------------+
Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | host_team    | guest_team    | host_goals  | guest_goals  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 10           | 20            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 10            | 2           | 2            |

| 4          | 20           | 30            | 1           | 0            |

+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| team_id    | team_name    | num_points    |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         | Leetcode FC  | 7             |

```

## Solutions

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the points each football team has earned based on their match results. Points are awarded as follows: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The result should be ordered by total points in descending order and by team ID in ascending order for ties.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Points for Each Match**: For each match, determine the points earned by both the host and guest teams based on the goals scored. This involves two separate calculations:
    - **Host Team Points**: Check if the host team won, drew, or lost and assign points accordingly.
    - **Guest Team Points**: Similarly, check the result from the guest team's perspective.
2. **Combine Points**: Use a UNION ALL to combine the points from both host and guest perspectives into a single list.
3. **Sum Points Per Team**: Aggregate the points for each team by summing up all the points they earned from all matches.
4. **Include All Teams**: Ensure all teams from the Teams table are included, even those that did not participate in any matches, by using a LEFT JOIN.
5. **Order Results**: Sort the results by total points in descending order and by team ID in ascending order for ties.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    t.team_id,
    t.team_name,
    COALESCE(SUM(p.points), 0) AS num_points
FROM Teams t
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT team_id, points
    FROM (
        SELECT host_team AS team_id,
            CASE
                WHEN host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3
                WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END AS points
        FROM Matches
        UNION ALL
        SELECT guest_team AS team_id,
            CASE
                WHEN guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3
                WHEN guest_goals = host_goals THEN 1
                ELSE 0
            END AS points
        FROM Matches
    ) AS match_points
) AS p ON t.team_id = p.team_id
GROUP BY t.team_id, t.team_name
ORDER BY num_points DESC, t.team_id ASC;
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate Points for Each Match**: The inner subquery processes each match twice, once from the host team's perspective and once from the guest team's perspective. Points are calculated using CASE statements based on the goals scored.
2. **Combine Points**: The UNION ALL combines the points from both host and guest perspectives into a single list of points for each team.
3. **Sum Points Per Team**: The LEFT JOIN ensures all teams are included, even those without matches. The COALESCE function ensures teams with no matches (and thus NULL points) are shown with 0 points.
4. **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by total points in descending order and by team ID for ties, ensuring the correct ranking.

This approach efficiently calculates the total points for each team and ensures all teams are included in the results, providing a comprehensive and accurate solution.
