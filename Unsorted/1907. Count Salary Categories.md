Table: `Accounts`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
```

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

- `"Low Salary"`: All the salaries **strictly less** than `$20000`.
- `"Average Salary"`: All the salaries in the **inclusive** range `[$20000, $50000]`.
- `"High Salary"`: All the salaries **strictly greater** than `$50000`.

The result table **must** contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return `0`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output:
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation:
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.
```

# Solution to Calculate Bank Accounts by Salary Category

To solve this problem, I need to categorize each bank account into one of three salary categories and count how many accounts fall into each category, including categories with zero accounts.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT
    'Low Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Average Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'High Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income > 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Accounts;
```

## Alternative Solution (Using a Categories Table)

```SQL
WITH Categories AS (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, 0 AS min_income, 19999 AS max_income
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Average Salary', 20000, 50000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'High Salary', 50001, 999999999
)
SELECT
    c.category,
    COUNT(a.account_id) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Categories c
LEFT JOIN
    Accounts a ON a.income BETWEEN c.min_income AND c.max_income
GROUP BY
    c.category;
```

## Explanation

1. **First Solution**:
    - Uses three separate queries joined with UNION ALL to create each category row
    - Each query counts accounts that match the category's income range using CASE statements
    - Automatically includes all categories even if count is zero
2. **Alternative Solution**:
    - Creates a temporary table with all three categories and their income ranges
    - LEFT JOINs with Accounts table to count matches for each category
    - GROUP BY ensures we get one row per category

For the example data:

- Account 2 (12747) falls into "Low Salary"
- No accounts fall into "Average Salary" (20000-50000)
- Accounts 3, 6, 8 fall into "High Salary" (>50000)

Both solutions correctly produce the output showing all three categories with their respective counts.

# Step-by-Step Explanation of the Salary Category Solution

Let me walk through my thought process and explain each part of the solution in detail:

## Understanding the Problem Requirements

1. **Three Distinct Categories**:
    - Low Salary: < $20,000
    - Average Salary: $20,000-$50,000 (inclusive)
    - High Salary: > $50,000
2. **Must Include All Categories**:
    - Even if a category has zero accounts, it must appear in results
3. **Count Accounts per Category**:
    - Need to count how many accounts fall into each bucket

## First Solution: Using UNION ALL with CASE Statements

### Step 1: Creating Each Category Separately

```SQL
SELECT
    'Low Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income < 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
```

- **Why CASE?**:
    - The CASE statement checks each account's income against the category criteria
    - Returns 1 if it matches, 0 otherwise
    - SUM() adds up all the 1s to get the count
- **Why hardcode 'Low Salary'?**:
    - We're creating this as a literal value since it's fixed for this category

### Step 2: Combining Categories with UNION ALL

```SQL
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Average Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts

UNION ALL
SELECT
    'High Salary' AS category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN income > 50000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts;
```

- **Why UNION ALL?**:
    - Combines the results of all three queries into one result set
    - ALL keeps duplicates (though none exist here) and is more efficient than UNION which removes duplicates
- **Why not use GROUP BY?**:
    - We could, but would need to first categorize each account then group
    - This approach is more straightforward for this specific case

## Second Solution: Using a Categories Table with JOIN

### Step 1: Creating a Categories Reference Table

```SQL
WITH Categories AS (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, 0 AS min_income, 19999 AS max_income
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Average Salary', 20000, 50000
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'High Salary', 50001, 999999999
)
```

- **Why create this CTE?**:
    - Defines all possible categories with their boundaries
    - Makes the query more maintainable if categories change
    - Clearly shows the income ranges

### Step 2: Joining with Accounts

```SQL
SELECT
    c.category,
    COUNT(a.account_id) AS accounts_count
FROM
    Categories c
LEFT JOIN
    Accounts a ON a.income BETWEEN c.min_income AND c.max_income
GROUP BY
    c.category;
```

- **Why LEFT JOIN?**:
    - Ensures all categories appear in results even with no matching accounts
    - Regular JOIN would exclude categories with zero counts
- **Why BETWEEN?**:
    - Clean way to check if income falls within a range
    - More readable than multiple AND conditions
- **Why COUNT?**:
    - Counts the number of matching accounts for each category
    - Returns 0 for categories with no matches due to LEFT JOIN

## Why Both Solutions Work

1. **First Solution Pros**:
    - Simpler for this specific problem
    - Fewer concepts involved (no CTE, no JOIN)
    - Easier to understand for beginners
2. **Second Solution Pros**:
    - More flexible if categories need to change
    - Cleaner separation of category definitions from counting logic
    - Easier to extend with more categories

## Example Walkthrough

For the input data:

- Account 2: 12747 → Low Salary
- Accounts 3,6,8: all >50000 → High Salary
- No accounts in 20000-50000 range → Average Salary shows 0

Both solutions correctly produce:

- Low Salary: 1
- Average Salary: 0
- High Salary: 3

The key is ensuring all categories appear regardless of whether they have matching accounts, which both approaches accomplish in different ways.
