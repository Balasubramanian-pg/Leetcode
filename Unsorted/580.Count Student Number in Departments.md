### **Description**

Table: `Student`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     | (pk)
| student_name | varchar |
| gender       | varchar |
| dept_id      | int     | (fk)
+--------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
dept_id is a foreign key (reference column) to dept_id in the Department tables.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student, their gender, and the id of their department.
```

Table: `Department`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| dept_id     | int     |(pk)
| dept_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
dept_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of a department.
```

Write a solution to report the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the `Department` table (even ones with no current students).

Return the result table **ordered** by `student_number` **in descending order**. In case of a tie, order them by `dept_name` **alphabetically**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Student table:
+------------+--------------+--------+---------+
| student_id | student_name | gender | dept_id |
+------------+--------------+--------+---------+
| 1          | Jack         | M      | 1       |
| 2          | Jane         | F      | 1       |
| 3          | Mark         | M      | 2       |
+------------+--------------+--------+---------+
Department table:
+---------+-------------+
| dept_id | dept_name   |
+---------+-------------+
| 1       | Engineering |
| 2       | Science     |
| 3       | Law         |
+---------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+----------------+
| dept_name   | student_number |
+-------------+----------------+
| Engineering | 2              |
| Science     | 1              |
| Law         | 0              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

**Solutions**

### Approach

To determine the number of students in each department, including departments with no students, we use a **left join** to combine the `Department` and `Student` tables. This ensures all departments are included. We then **count the students** per department and **order** the results by student count (descending) and department name (ascending for ties).

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(s.student_id) AS student_number
FROM Department d
LEFT JOIN Student s ON d.dept_id = s.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_id
ORDER BY student_number DESC, d.dept_name ASC;
```

### Explanation

1. **Left Join**: Ensures all departments from the `Department` table are included, even those without students.
2. **Group By**: Groups results by `dept_id` to aggregate student counts per department.
3. **COUNT(student_id)**: Counts non-null student IDs, resulting in `0` for departments without students.
4. **Order By**: Sorts first by `student_number` (descending) to prioritize departments with more students, then by `dept_name` (ascending) to resolve ties alphabetically.

This approach efficiently combines and aggregates data to meet the problem requirements.

  

# SQL Insert Statements for Student and Department Tables

Here are the PostgreSQL-compatible commands to create and populate both tables with the provided data:

```SQL
-- Create Department table
CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create Student table with foreign key
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(1),
    dept_id INT REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
);

-- Insert data into Department table
INSERT INTO Department (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES
(1, 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Science'),
(3, 'Law');

-- Insert data into Student table
INSERT INTO Student (student_id, student_name, gender, dept_id) VALUES
(1, 'Jack', 'M', 1),
(2, 'Jane', 'F', 1),
(3, 'Mark', 'M', 2);
```

## Bonus : Query to Report Only Department Student With Counts

# Filtering Out Departments with Zero Students

If you want to exclude departments that have no students, you can modify the query by:

1. Using an INNER JOIN instead of LEFT JOIN
2. Or adding a HAVING clause to filter after aggregation

Here are both approaches:

## Option 1: Using INNER JOIN

```SQL
SELECT
    d.dept_name,
    COUNT(s.student_id) AS student_number
FROM
    Department d
INNER JOIN
    Student s ON d.dept_id = s.dept_id
GROUP BY
    d.dept_id, d.dept_name
ORDER BY
    student_number DESC,
    d.dept_name ASC;
```

## Option 2: Using LEFT JOIN with HAVING

```SQL
SELECT
    d.dept_name,
    COUNT(s.student_id) AS student_number
FROM
    Department d
LEFT JOIN
    Student s ON d.dept_id = s.dept_id
GROUP BY
    d.dept_id, d.dept_name
HAVING
    COUNT(s.student_id) > 0
ORDER BY
    student_number DESC,
    d.dept_name ASC;
```

## Result for Both Options (with the sample data):

```Plain
+-------------+----------------+
| dept_name   | student_number |
+-------------+----------------+
| Engineering | 2              |
| Science     | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
```

Key differences from the original solution:

- Both methods exclude the "Law" department which has 0 students
- INNER JOIN is generally more efficient for this case
- LEFT JOIN + HAVING is useful if you need to do other filtering that requires keeping NULLs temporarily

Both approaches will give you the same result when you want to exclude departments with no students.
