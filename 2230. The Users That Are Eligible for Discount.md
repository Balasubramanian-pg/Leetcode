**Description**

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| user_id     | int      |
| time_stamp  | datetime |
| amount      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the purchase time and the amount paid for the user with ID user_id.
```

A user is eligible for a discount if they had a purchase in the inclusive interval of time `[startDate, endDate]` with at least `minAmount` amount. To convert the dates to times, both dates should be considered as the **start** of the day (i.e., `endDate = 2022-03-05` should be considered as the time `2022-03-05 00:00:00`).

Write a solution to report the IDs of the users that are eligible for a discount.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Purchases table:
+---------+---------------------+--------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | amount |
+---------+---------------------+--------+
| 1       | 2022-04-20 09:03:00 | 4416   |
| 2       | 2022-03-19 19:24:02 | 678    |
| 3       | 2022-03-18 12:03:09 | 4523   |
| 3       | 2022-03-30 09:43:42 | 626    |
+---------+---------------------+--------+
startDate = 2022-03-08, endDate = 2022-03-20, minAmount = 1000
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
+---------+
Explanation:
Out of the three users, only User 3 is eligible for a discount.
 - User 1 had one purchase with at least minAmount amount, but not within the time interval.
 - User 2 had one purchase within the time interval, but with less than minAmount amount.
 - User 3 is the only user who had a purchase that satisfies both conditions.
```

**Important Note:** This problem is basically the same as [The Number of Users That Are Eligible for Discount](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-users-that-are-eligible-for-discount/).

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find users who are eligible for a discount based on these criteria:

1. They made a purchase within a specified date range (`startDate` to `endDate` inclusive)
2. The purchase amount is at least `minAmount`

We need to return the user IDs in ascending order.

## Step 1: Start with basic query structure

```SQL
SELECT user_id
FROM Purchases
```

Explanation: We begin with a simple query that selects user IDs from the Purchases table. This is our starting point.

## Step 2: Add the purchase amount filter

```SQL
SELECT user_id
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
```

Explanation: We add a filter to only include purchases with an amount of at least `minAmount` (1000 in the example).

## Step 3: Add the date range filter

```SQL
SELECT user_id
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp <= '2022-03-20 23:59:59'
```

Explanation: We add a date range filter. We need to include the entire `startDate` and `endDate`.

## Step 4: Adjust the end date based on problem description

```SQL
SELECT user_id
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp < '2022-03-21 00:00:00'
```

Explanation: The problem states that `endDate` should be considered as the start of the day. To include the entire day of `endDate`, we need to use the start of the next day as the upper bound (exclusive).

## Step 5: Select distinct users and add ordering

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp < '2022-03-21 00:00:00'
ORDER BY user_id
```

Explanation: We use DISTINCT to ensure each eligible user appears only once in the result, and we add ORDER BY to sort the results by user_id as required.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM Purchases
WHERE amount >= 1000
AND time_stamp >= '2022-03-08 00:00:00'
AND time_stamp < '2022-03-21 00:00:00'
ORDER BY user_id
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Selects distinct user IDs who made qualifying purchases
2. Filters for purchases with an amount of at least 1000 (minAmount)
3. Filters for purchases within the specified date range, interpreting both dates as the start of the day
4. Orders the results by user_id as required

The query handles the example case correctly, returning only user_id = 3, who is the only user that meets both the amount and date criteria.
