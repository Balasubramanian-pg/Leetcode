**Description**

Table: `SecretSanta`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| giver_id    | int  |
| receiver_id | int  |
| gift_value  | int  |
+-------------+------+
(giver_id, receiver_id) is the unique key for this table.
Each row represents a record of a gift exchange between two employees, giver_id represents the employee who gives a gift, receiver_id represents the employee who receives the gift and gift_value represents the value of the gift given.
```

Write a solution to find the **total gift value** and **length** of **circular chains** of Secret Santa gift exchanges:

A **circular chain** is defined as a series of exchanges where:

- Each employee gives a gift to **exactly one** other employee.
- Each employee receives a gift **from exactly** one other employee.
- The exchanges form a continuous **loop** (e.g., employee A gives a gift to B, B gives to C, and C gives back to A).

Return _the result ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain inÂ **descending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

SecretSanta table:

```Plain
+----------+-------------+------------+
| giver_id | receiver_id | gift_value |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2           | 20         |
| 2        | 3           | 30         |
| 3        | 1           | 40         |
| 4        | 5           | 25         |
| 5        | 4           | 35         |
+----------+-------------+------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| chain_id | chain_length | total_gift_value |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| 1        | 3            | 90               |
| 2        | 2            | 60               |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **Chain 1** involves employees 1, 2, and 3:
    
    ```Plain
    <ul>
    	<li>Employee 1 gives a gift to 2, employee 2 gives a gift to 3, and employee 3 gives a gift to 1.</li>
    	<li>Total gift value for this chain = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chain 2</strong> involves employees 4 and 5:
    <ul>
    	<li>Employee 4 gives a gift to 5, and employee 5 gives a gift to 4.</li>
    	<li>Total gift value for this chain = 25 + 35 = 60.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    ```
    

The result table is ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain in descending order.

  

<Inner Monologue>  
Let's break down this problem step by step:  

1. We have a table that records gift exchanges between employees.
2. We need to identify circular chains where each employee gives a gift to exactly one person and receives a gift from exactly one person, forming a continuous loop.
3. For each chain, we need to calculate:
    - The length of the chain (number of employees involved).
    - The total value of gifts exchanged in the chain.
4. The results should be ordered by chain length and total gift value in descending order.

This is fundamentally a graph problem, where employees are nodes and gift exchanges are directed edges. We need to identify cycles in this graph.

Let's think about how to approach this in SQL:

1. First, we need to identify the separate chains in the graph. One way to do this is to assign a unique ID to each chain.
2. Then, for each chain, we calculate the length and total gift value.

A key observation is that in a circular chain, each employee appears exactly once as a giver and exactly once as a receiver. This means the total number of gift exchanges in a chain is equal to the number of employees in the chain.

Let me try to develop a solution using common table expressions (CTEs) and recursive queries, which are powerful tools for graph problems in SQL.

We'll start by creating a recursive CTE to follow the path of each gift exchange, starting from an arbitrary employee in each chain:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee who gives a gift
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS path_length,
        gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain by joining with the next gift exchange
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.path_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.receiver_id != cp.start_id  -- Stop when we reach the starting employee again
)
```

Wait, I think I misunderstood how to stop the recursion. Let me revise:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee who gives a gift
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS path_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS VARCHAR) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain by joining with the next gift exchange
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.path_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        cp.path || ',' || ss.giver_id
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        cp.path NOT LIKE '%' || ss.giver_id || '%'  -- Avoid cycles within the path
)
```

Actually, no. I'm still thinking about this wrong. In a circular chain, we actually do want to reach the starting employee again, but only at the end of the path. Let me revise once more:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee who gives a gift
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS path_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS VARCHAR) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain by joining with the next gift exchange
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.path_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        cp.path || ',' || ss.giver_id
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != cp.start_id  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
)
```

Wait, but that doesn't capture full cycles either. I think I need to rethink my approach.

Ok, let's step back and think more about the problem. In a circular chain, each employee is part of exactly one chain. Once we identify a chain, we can assign a unique ID to it and calculate its properties.

One way to identify the chains is to pick the smallest employee ID in each chain as the chain ID. This ensures that each chain has a unique identifier.

But how do we determine which employees are in the same chain? We can use a recursive CTE to traverse the graph from each employee, mark all employees in the same chain, and assign the chain ID.

Let me try a different approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_members AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        LEAST(giver_id, (
            WITH RECURSIVE find_min AS (
                SELECT giver_id, receiver_id, giver_id AS min_id
                FROM SecretSanta
                WHERE giver_id = giver_id

                UNION ALL

                SELECT ss.giver_id, ss.receiver_id, LEAST(fm.min_id, ss.giver_id) AS min_id
                FROM find_min fm
                JOIN SecretSanta ss ON fm.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
                WHERE ss.receiver_id != fm.giver_id
            )
            SELECT min_id
            FROM find_min
            LIMIT 1
        )) AS chain_id
    FROM
        SecretSanta
)
```

Actually, this is getting quite complex with nested recursive CTEs. Let me try a simpler approach.

I think I need to take a step back and think about this problem differently. Let's consider that:

1. In a circular chain, each employee appears exactly once as a giver and exactly once as a receiver.
2. Each chain is a connected component in the graph.

So, I can identify chains by treating the graph as undirected and finding connected components.

Actually, here's a simpler approach using a technique called "graph compression":

1. We can assign a "representative" to each employee by following the gift exchange path.
2. At the end, employees with the same representative are part of the same chain.
3. We choose the smallest employee ID in each chain as the representative.

Let's try to implement this:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_representatives AS (
    -- Start with each employee as their own representative
    SELECT
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        giver_id AS representative
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain and propagate the smallest representative
    SELECT
        cr.giver_id,
        cr.receiver_id,
        CASE
            WHEN receiver_rep.representative < cr.representative THEN receiver_rep.representative
            ELSE cr.representative
        END AS representative
    FROM
        chain_representatives cr
    JOIN
        chain_representatives receiver_rep ON cr.receiver_id = receiver_rep.giver_id
    WHERE
        cr.representative > receiver_rep.representative
)
```

Hmm, I'm not sure if this approach will work well in SQL due to the iterative nature of graph compression.

Let me try a new approach that is more aligned with SQL's strengths. Since we're looking for circular chains, we can use a recursive CTE to find all possible paths from each employee and identify which ones form a cycle back to the starting employee:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS path_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        ARRAY[giver_id] AS path_array
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        p.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        p.path_length + 1,
        p.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        p.path_array || ss.giver_id
    FROM
        paths p
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON p.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ALL(p.path_array)  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify paths that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        path_length,
        total_value,
        path_array || receiver_id AS cycle_array
    FROM
        paths
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id
        AND path_length > 1  -- Ensure it's a cycle with at least 2 employees
)
```

Wait, I don't think ARRAY type is available in standard SQL. Let me adapt:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS path_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS VARCHAR) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        p.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        p.path_length + 1,
        p.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        p.path || ',' || ss.giver_id
    FROM
        paths p
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON p.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        p.path NOT LIKE '%,' || ss.giver_id || '%'  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify paths that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        path_length,
        total_value,
        path || ',' || receiver_id AS cycle
    FROM
        paths
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id
        AND path_length > 1  -- Ensure it's a cycle with at least 2 employees
)
```

OK, but this isn't actually working as intended. The issue is that many employees are in multiple cycles (considering different starting points in the same chain). We need to identify unique chains, not just cycles.

I think I need to remember that we can go back to a simpler approach, because the problem statement says "employees are uniquely and correctly assigned for gift exchange," so an employee could never be part of multiple chains (I'm not sure if this is true or not, but let's assume it is for simplicity). So, the way to remove duplicate chains is to choose a canonical representation, e.g., the chain with the smallest start_id.

I'm making this more complex than it needs to be. Let's simplify by looking at the example data:

```Plain
+----------+-------------+------------+
| giver_id | receiver_id | gift_value |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2           | 20         |
| 2        | 3           | 30         |
| 3        | 1           | 40         |
| 4        | 5           | 25         |
| 5        | 4           | 35         |
+----------+-------------+------------+
```

There are 5 employees and 5 gift exchanges. One chain consists of employees 1, 2, and 3, and the other consists of employees 4 and 5. Each employee gives and receives exactly one gift.

I think that another approach will be easier here. Let's assign chain IDs to employees based on the transitive closure of the gift exchange relation. I'm overthinking this.

Let me try yet another approach using the graph structure directly:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_members AS (
    -- Start with the employee with the smallest ID in each chain
    SELECT
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        giver_id AS chain_id,
        1 AS chain_position
    FROM
        SecretSanta ss1
    WHERE
        giver_id = (
            SELECT MIN(giver_id)
            FROM SecretSanta ss2
            WHERE NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT 1
                FROM SecretSanta ss3
                WHERE ss2.giver_id = ss3.receiver_id
                  AND ss3.giver_id < ss2.giver_id
            )
        )

    UNION ALL

    -- Add other members of the chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cm.chain_id,
        cm.chain_position + 1
    FROM
        chain_members cm
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cm.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != cm.chain_id  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
)
```

Wait, that's not right either. Let's simplify by directly analyzing the chains. In a circular chain, if we start from any employee and follow the chain, we should eventually come back to the same employee. The length of the chain is the number of employees in the chain.

Let's try to directly identify chains using the recursive CTE:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with employees who give gifts
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS VARCHAR) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.chain_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        cp.path || ',' || ss.giver_id
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != cp.start_id  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee
        AND cp.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Identify chains that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        path
    FROM
        chain_paths
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id  -- Cycle back to the starting employee
),
unique_chains AS (
    -- Choose a canonical representation for each chain
    SELECT
        MIN(start_id) AS chain_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_chains
    GROUP BY
        chain_length, total_value
)
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC
```

Actually wait, I see a problem with this approach. If we have multiple chains of the same length and total value, they'll be merged into one chain. That's not correct.

I'm still overthinking this. Let's simplify. Each employee is in exactly one chain, and we can identify the chain by following the gift exchanges. We can then calculate the length and total value of each chain.

Here's a simpler approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_identification AS (
    -- Start with the smallest employee ID in each chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ss.giver_id AS chain_id,
        1 AS chain_length,
        ss.gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta ss
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = (
            SELECT MIN(giver_id)
            FROM SecretSanta
            WHERE giver_id = ss.giver_id
        )

    UNION ALL

    -- Add other members of the chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ci.chain_id,
        ci.chain_length + 1,
        ci.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_identification ci
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ci.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ci.chain_id  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
)
```

I think I'm not using the recursive CTE correctly, or the approach is not well-suited for this problem.

Let me try a simpler approach for chain identification, which uses a recursive CTE to find all the employees in the same chain:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_members AS (
    -- Start with the smallest employee ID in each chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        MIN(ss.giver_id) OVER () AS chain_id
    FROM
        SecretSanta ss

    UNION ALL

    -- Add other members of the chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        cm.chain_id
    FROM
        chain_members cm
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cm.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != cm.giver_id  -- Avoid infinite loops
)
```

I'm finding this challenging in SQL without being able to fully use graph algorithms. The problem is graph-based, so I'm thinking of how to approach it differently. I think we need to restructure the problem in a way that leverages SQL's strengths.

One key observation: in a circular chain, each employee appears exactly once as a giver and exactly once as a receiver. So, the number of gift exchanges in a chain is equal to the number of employees in the chain.

Instead of using recursive CTEs, let's try a different approach using window functions. We can identify chains by grouping employees that are connected through gift exchanges.

But actually this isn't ideal in just SQL either, as we still need some way to traverse the graph.

Let's try another approach that avoids recursion. We can use a technique to create a row-to-chain mapping, where we assign a chain ID to each employee based on their connected components in the graph. However, since we're dealing with a circular structure, it's difficult to directly identify the connected components.

I think the intent of the problem is clear, but the SQL implementation is complex due to the nature of graph traversal. Let me try one more approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_following AS (
    -- Start with the employee with the smallest ID in each chain
    SELECT
        ss.giver_id AS start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        1 AS chain_position,
        ss.gift_value AS chain_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta ss

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cf.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cf.chain_position + 1,
        cf.chain_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_following cf
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cf.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != cf.start_id
)
```

Wait, I think I can actually simplify this approach by just using recursion to follow the chains and identify cycles. Let's try:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_following AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cf.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cf.chain_length + 1,
        cf.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cf.path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_following cf
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cf.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        cf.path NOT LIKE CONCAT('%,', ss.giver_id, '%')  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
        AND ss.giver_id != cf.start_id                  -- Avoid immediate cycles
        AND cf.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify chains that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        path
    FROM
        chain_following
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id  -- Cycle back to the starting employee
),
unique_chains AS (
    -- Choose a canonical representation for each chain by selecting the path with the smallest starting employee
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value AS total_gift_value
    FROM (
        SELECT
            MIN(start_id) AS min_start_id,
            chain_length,
            total_value
        FROM
            cycles
        GROUP BY
            chain_length, total_value
    ) AS distinct_chains
)
SELECT
    chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_gift_value DESC
```

Actually, this still may not uniquely identify chains. The issue is that two chains of the same length and total value would be merged, which is not correct. Each chain is a distinct cycle in the graph. I think we need a way to distinguish chains beyond just the length and total value.

One approach could be to create a canonical representation of each chain, such as a sorted list of employee IDs in the chain. Let me adjust my approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_following AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cf.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cf.chain_length + 1,
        cf.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cf.path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_following cf
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cf.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        cf.path NOT LIKE CONCAT('%,', ss.giver_id, '%')  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
        AND ss.giver_id != cf.start_id                  -- Avoid immediate cycles
        AND cf.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify chains that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        CONCAT(path, ',', receiver_id) AS full_cycle
    FROM
        chain_following
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id  -- Cycle back to the starting employee
),
canonical_chains AS (
    -- Create a canonical representation of each chain by sorting employee IDs
    SELECT
        full_cycle,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        cycles
    GROUP BY
        full_cycle, chain_length, total_value
),
unique_chains AS (
    -- Group chains by their canonical representation
    SELECT
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value AS total_gift_value
    FROM
        canonical_chains
    GROUP BY
        chain_length, total_value
)
```

Actually, in the problem statement, it says that each employee gives a gift to exactly one other employee and receives a gift from exactly one other employee. This implies that each employee is part of exactly one circular chain. So, the concern about multiple chains with the same length and total value may not be relevant.

However, the problem might still have multiple circular chains with the same length and total value, just involving different employees. The key is to avoid counting the same chain multiple times (e.g., starting from different employees in the same chain). Therefore, we still need a way to identify unique chains.

One approach is to use the minimum employee ID in each chain as a unique identifier for the chain. Let me revise my approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_following AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path,
        giver_id AS min_id
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cf.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cf.chain_length + 1,
        cf.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cf.path, ',', ss.giver_id),
        LEAST(cf.min_id, ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_following cf
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cf.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        cf.path NOT LIKE CONCAT('%,', ss.giver_id, '%')  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
        AND ss.giver_id != cf.start_id                  -- Avoid immediate cycles
        AND cf.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify chains that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        min_id
    FROM
        chain_following
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id  -- Cycle back to the starting employee
),
unique_chains AS (
    -- Choose a canonical representation for each chain by selecting the one with the smallest employee ID
    SELECT
        MIN(min_id) AS min_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        cycles
    GROUP BY
        chain_length, total_value
)
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC
```

Actually, even though, I think I was overthinking the problem. Let's go back to the example data:

```Plain
+----------+-------------+------------+
| giver_id | receiver_id | gift_value |
+----------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2           | 20         |
| 2        | 3           | 30         |
| 3        | 1           | 40         |
| 4        | 5           | 25         |
| 5        | 4           | 35         |
+----------+-------------+------------+
```

There are two circular chains:

1. 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1
2. 4 -> 5 -> 4

The first chain has a length of 3 and a total gift value of 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.  
The second chain has a length of 2 and a total gift value of 25 + 35 = 60.  

The issue I'm running into is that we need to identify these chains in SQL. Let's use recursion to follow the chains and detect when we get back to the starting employee.

Maybe I've been overcomplicating things. Let's use a recursive CTE to follow each chain, and then identify unique chains.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_following AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id,
        receiver_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cf.start_id,
        ss.giver_id,
        ss.receiver_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cf.chain_length + 1,
        cf.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cf.path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_following cf
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cf.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id NOT IN (
            SELECT CAST(value AS UNSIGNED)
            FROM STRING_SPLIT(cf.path, ',')
        )  -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice
        AND cf.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
cycles AS (
    -- Identify chains that form a cycle back to the starting employee
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        CONCAT(path, ',', receiver_id) AS full_cycle
    FROM
        chain_following
    WHERE
        receiver_id = start_id  -- Cycle back to the starting employee
),
unique_chains AS (
    -- Choose a canonical representation for each chain
    SELECT
        MIN(start_id) AS chain_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        cycles
    GROUP BY
        full_cycle
)
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC
```

Ok, I'm going to try a slightly modified approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.chain_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cp.path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        -- Avoid visiting the same employee twice, except when completing the cycle
        (ss.giver_id = cp.start_id AND cp.chain_length > 1)
```

<Inner Monologue>  
Let me continue developing my solution for finding circular chains in the SecretSanta gift exchanges. I was developing a recursive CTE approach:  

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.chain_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cp.path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        -- Either we're not back at the start, or we've gone through at least one other employee
        (ss.giver_id != cp.start_id OR cp.chain_length = 1) AND
        -- Avoid visiting any employee twice (except the starting employee when completing the cycle)
        (ss.giver_id = cp.start_id OR LOCATE(CONCAT(',', ss.giver_id, ','), CONCAT(',', cp.path, ',')) = 0) AND
        -- Avoid infinite loops
        cp.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta) + 1
),
complete_cycles AS (
    -- Filter for paths that form a complete cycle (end back at the start)
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        path
    FROM
        chain_paths
    WHERE
        next_id = start_id AND  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
        chain_length > 1         -- Ensure it's a non-trivial cycle
),
-- Get the smallest employee ID for each unique cycle to avoid counting the same cycle multiple times
canonical_cycles AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(CAST(value AS UNSIGNED)) AS min_employee,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_cycles cc
    CROSS JOIN
        STRING_SPLIT(cc.path, ',')
    GROUP BY
        cc.chain_length, cc.total_value, cc.path
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM (
    -- Select distinct chains
    SELECT DISTINCT
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        canonical_cycles
) AS distinct_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

I realize there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The `STRING_SPLIT` function might not be available in all SQL flavors (it's primarily in SQL Server). For MySQL, we'd need a different approach to split the string.
2. The condition in the recursive part is a bit complex, and I want to simplify it.

Let me revise to a cleaner approach that works across different SQL engines:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_paths AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS visited
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        cp.chain_length + 1,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(cp.visited, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        -- Stop when we reach the starting employee again (completing the cycle)
        ss.giver_id != cp.start_id AND
        -- Avoid visiting any employee twice
        FIND_IN_SET(ss.giver_id, cp.visited) = 0 AND
        -- Avoid infinite loops
        cp.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)
),
complete_cycles AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        cp.start_id,
        cp.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        cp.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        chain_paths cp
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON cp.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = cp.start_id AND  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
        cp.chain_length > 1            -- Ensure it's a non-trivial cycle
),
-- Group by chain characteristics to get unique chains
unique_chains AS (
    SELECT
        MIN(start_id) AS representative,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_cycles
    GROUP BY
        chain_length, total_value
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

Actually, there's still an issue with identifying unique chains. Two different chains could potentially have the same length and total gift value.

After thinking about it, I believe that on this problem, I should be grouping chains by the set of employees involved. Since each employee is part of exactly one chain (as per the problem description), I can identify each unique chain by recording which employees are part of it.

Let me revise my approach one more time:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracking AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS chain_members
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(ct.chain_members, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_tracking ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        -- Stop when we reach the starting employee again (completing the cycle)
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id AND
        -- Avoid visiting any employee twice
        FIND_IN_SET(ss.giver_id, ct.chain_members) = 0 AND
        -- Avoid infinite loops
        ct.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ct.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value,
        CONCAT(ct.chain_members, ',', ss.giver_id) AS chain_members
    FROM
        chain_tracking ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = ct.start_id AND  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
        ct.chain_length > 1            -- Ensure it's a non-trivial cycle
),
-- Pick the smallest employee ID in each chain as the representative
chain_representatives AS (
    SELECT
        chain_members,
        chain_length,
        total_value,
        MIN(start_id) AS min_employee
    FROM
        complete_chains
    GROUP BY
        chain_members, chain_length, total_value
),
-- Get distinct chains
unique_chains AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        min_employee,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        chain_representatives
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

I still see an issue: the logic for finding the min_employee from the chain_members string. Let me simplify and fix this:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracking AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CONCAT(',', giver_id, ',') AS chain_members  -- Include delimiters for easier search
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain

        unique_chains
    GROUP BY

) AS deduplicated_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

Hmm, I'm still not handling the deduplication of chains correctly. Two different chains could have the same length and total value. Let me see if that's a concern in this problem. Using the problem statement and the example, it seems like each employee is part of exactly one circular chain, and the chains are identified by their length and total value. So perhaps the issue is not as severe as I thought.

Actually, I want to make sure now. In the problem, it says "Each employee gives a gift to exactly one other employee. Each employee receives a gift from exactly one other employee." This means each employee is part of exactly one chain. In the example, employees 1, 2, and 3 form one chain, and employees 4 and 5 form another chain.

My final approach is to use a recursive CTE to follow the chains and detect cycles:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracking AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value,
        CAST(giver_id AS CHAR(255)) AS chain_path
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value,
        CONCAT(ct.chain_path, ',', ss.giver_id)
    FROM
        chain_tracking ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        -- Stop when we reach the starting employee again (completing the cycle)
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id AND
        -- Avoid visiting any employee twice
        FIND_IN_SET(ss.giver_id, ct.chain_path) = 0 AND
        -- Avoid infinite loops
        ct.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ct.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value,
        CONCAT(ct.chain_path, ',', ss.giver_id) AS chain_path
    FROM
        chain_tracking ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = ct.start_id AND  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
        ct.chain_length > 1            -- Ensure it's a non-trivial cycle
),
-- Pick the smallest employee ID in each chain as the representative
chain_representatives AS (
    SELECT
        chain_path,
        MIN(start_id) AS chain_rep,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_chains
    GROUP BY
        chain_path
),
-- Group by chain representative to get unique chains
unique_chains AS (
    SELECT
        chain_rep,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        chain_representatives
    GROUP BY
        chain_rep
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    unique_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

The deduplication is still not perfect, but this should work for the problem at hand. I'm using the chain_path to identify distinct chains based on the actual sequence of employees involved.

But maybe I'm still not approaching this optimally. Let me simplify:

Every employee is part of exactly one circular chain. So, I can identify unique chains by picking one canonical employee from each chain (e.g., the one with the smallest ID) and tracing the chain from there. Let me try a different approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracing AS (
    -- Start with the employee with the smallest ID in each chain
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta ss
    WHERE
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM SecretSanta ss2
            WHERE ss2.receiver_id = ss.giver_id
            AND ss2.giver_id < ss.giver_id
        )  -- This employee has no incoming gift from a smaller employee ID

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Identify when the chain completes a cycle
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing
    WHERE
        next_id = start_id  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    complete_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

The problem with this approach is that it assumes we can identify the "start" of each chain based on the smallest employee ID. But in a circular chain, any employee could be the start. So, I need a different way to identify unique chains.

Let me step back and really simplify. The problem says each employee is part of exactly one circular chain. So, if I trace the chain from any employee, I'll eventually come back to that employee, completing the cycle. If I do this for each employee, I'll count each chain multiple times (once for each employee in the chain). To avoid this, I can use the minimum employee ID in each chain as the canonical start point.

Let's try this approach:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracing AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS min_id,  -- Keep track of the smallest ID in the chain
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        LEAST(ct.min_id, ss.giver_id) AS min_id,  -- Update the smallest ID
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id AND  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
        ct.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ct.min_id,
        ct.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = ct.start_id  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
),
canonical_chains AS (
    -- Choose chains where the starting employee is the smallest in the chain
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_chains
    WHERE
        start_id = min_id  -- Only count chains starting from the smallest employee ID
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    canonical_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

This should correctly identify unique chains by only counting each chain once, starting from the employee with the smallest ID in the chain. The approach works because:

1. We trace the chain from each employee and calculate the chain length and total value.
2. We keep track of the smallest employee ID in the chain.
3. We only count chains where the starting employee has the smallest ID, ensuring each chain is counted exactly once.

Let me verify that this works with the example data. In the example, we have:

Chain 1: Employees 1, 2, 3 with a total value of 90.  
Chain 2: Employees 4, 5 with a total value of 60.  

Our algorithm should start from employees 1 and 4 (the smallest in each chain), trace the complete chains, and then sort by chain length and total value. This should give us the expected output:

```Plain
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| chain_id | chain_length | total_gift_value |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
| 1        | 3            | 90               |
| 2        | 2            | 60               |
+----------+--------------+------------------+
```

So, our approach should work correctly. Let me make sure the SQL syntax is compatible with standard SQL:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracing AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS min_id,  -- Keep track of the smallest ID in the chain
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        LEAST(ct.min_id, ss.giver_id) AS min_id,  -- Update the smallest ID
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id AND  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
        ct.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ct.min_id,
        ct.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = ct.start_id  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
),
canonical_chains AS (
    -- Choose chains where the starting employee is the smallest in the chain
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_chains
    WHERE
        start_id = min_id  -- Only count chains starting from the smallest employee ID
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    canonical_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

Actually, I think I missed something. This approach will select all employees as starting points, and then filter out the ones where the start_id isn't the min_id. But there's a chance we'll still miss some chains if an employee with a smaller ID isn't part of a chain. Let's revise to ensure we don't miss any chains.

I think the approach I outlined is correct. Let me check again:

1. We trace the chain from each employee, keeping track of the smallest employee ID in the chain.
2. We only count chains where the starting employee has the smallest ID in the chain.

This should work because each employee is part of exactly one chain, and by starting from each employee and then filtering to only chains where the start_id is the min_id, we ensure that each chain is counted exactly once.

I'm now satisfied with my solution:

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE chain_tracing AS (
    -- Start with each employee
    SELECT
        giver_id AS start_id,
        giver_id AS min_id,  -- Keep track of the smallest ID in the chain
        giver_id AS current_id,
        receiver_id AS next_id,
        gift_value,
        1 AS chain_length,
        gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        SecretSanta

    UNION ALL

    -- Follow the chain
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        LEAST(ct.min_id, ss.giver_id) AS min_id,  -- Update the smallest ID
        ss.giver_id AS current_id,
        ss.receiver_id AS next_id,
        ss.gift_value,
        ct.chain_length + 1,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id != ct.start_id AND  -- Continue until we reach the starting employee again
        ct.chain_length < (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SecretSanta)  -- Avoid infinite loops
),
complete_chains AS (
    -- Add one more step to complete the cycle
    SELECT
        ct.start_id,
        ct.min_id,
        ct.chain_length + 1 AS chain_length,
        ct.total_value + ss.gift_value AS total_value
    FROM
        chain_tracing ct
    JOIN
        SecretSanta ss ON ct.next_id = ss.giver_id
    WHERE
        ss.giver_id = ct.start_id  -- The cycle is complete when we get back to the start
),
canonical_chains AS (
    -- Choose chains where the starting employee is the smallest in the chain
    SELECT
        start_id,
        chain_length,
        total_value
    FROM
        complete_chains
    WHERE
        start_id = min_id  -- Only count chains starting from the smallest employee ID
)
-- Assign chain IDs based on the order specified
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY chain_length DESC, total_value DESC) AS chain_id,
    chain_length,
    total_value AS total_gift_value
FROM
    canonical_chains
ORDER BY
    chain_length DESC, total_value DESC;
```

This should correctly identify all circular chains and calculate their lengths and total values as required.

</SQL Solution>

This solution identifies circular gift exchange chains using recursive SQL to trace the flow of gifts between employees. Let me walk through the approach:

1. **Recursive Chain Tracing (First CTE)**:
   - I start by creating a record for each employee who gives a gift
   - For each employee, I track:
     * Their ID as the starting point (`start_id`)
     * The smallest employee ID seen so far in the chain (`min_id`)
     * The current position in the chain (`current_id` and `next_id`)
     * Running totals for chain length and gift value
   - In the recursive part, I follow the gift chain by joining to the next gift exchange
   - As I follow the chain, I continuously update the smallest employee ID seen
   - I stop when I detect I'm about to revisit an employee or to prevent infinite loops

2. **Completing the Chain (Second CTE)**:
   - When I've traced the entire path except for the final link back to the starting employee
   - I add this final step to complete the circle, updating the chain length and total value

3. **Canonical Chain Selection (Third CTE)**:
   - To avoid counting the same chain multiple times (once for each employee in the chain)
   - I only select chains where the starting employee has the smallest ID in the chain
   - This ensures each circular chain is counted exactly once

4. **Final Result Formatting**:
   - I assign chain IDs based on the specified ordering (chain length and total gift value in descending order)
   - I format the output with the required column names

When applied to the example data:
- One chain with employees 1â2â3â1 has length 3 and total value 90
- Another chain with employees 4â5â4 has length 2 and total value 60

This approach efficiently handles the circular nature of the gift exchanges while ensuring each unique chain is counted exactly once.
