**Description**

Table: `Calls`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key (column with unique values), it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id
```

Write a solutionÂ to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons `(person1, person2)` where `person1 < person2`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+
Output:
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |
| 1       | 3       | 1          | 20             |
| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Explanation:
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).
```

**Solutions**

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to:

1. Report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons
2. Ensure person1 < person2 for each pair
3. Count calls in both directions as part of the same pair

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Transform the data to ensure person1 < person2

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END AS person1,
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN to_id ELSE from_id END AS person2,
    duration
FROM
    Calls;
```

Explanation: This query transforms the call data so that the smaller ID is always person1 and the larger ID is always person2, regardless of who initiated the call. This ensures we'll count calls in both directions as part of the same person pair.

### Step 2: Group and aggregate the results

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END AS person1,
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN to_id ELSE from_id END AS person2,
    COUNT(*) AS call_count,
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM
    Calls
GROUP BY
    person1, person2;
```

Explanation: Now we're grouping by the person pairs and counting the number of calls and summing up the total duration. However, this query isn't quite right because we're trying to group by aliases (person1 and person2), which might not work in all SQL implementations.

### Step 3: Fix the grouping to use the full expressions

```SQL
SELECT
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END AS person1,
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN to_id ELSE from_id END AS person2,
    COUNT(*) AS call_count,
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM
    Calls
GROUP BY
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN from_id ELSE to_id END,
    CASE WHEN from_id < to_id THEN to_id ELSE from_id END;
```

Explanation: We've adjusted the GROUP BY clause to use the same expressions as in the SELECT statement. This ensures the grouping works correctly across different SQL implementations.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    LEAST(from_id, to_id) AS person1,
    GREATEST(from_id, to_id) AS person2,
    COUNT(*) AS call_count,
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM
    Calls
GROUP BY
    person1, person2;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution, using the LEAST and GREATEST functions for a cleaner implementation. LEAST(from_id, to_id) returns the smaller of the two IDs, which becomes person1. GREATEST(from_id, to_id) returns the larger ID, which becomes person2. We then count the calls and sum the durations for each unique pair. Since we're using standard SQL functions, this approach should work across most SQL implementations and it's easier to read.
