**Description**

Table: `Buses`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
| capacity     | int  |
+--------------+------+
bus_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the LeetCode station and its capacity (the number of empty seats it has).
No two buses will arrive at the same time and all bus capacities will be positive integers.
```

Table: `Passengers`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
passenger_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the LeetCode station.
```

Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at a time `tbus` and a passenger arrived at a time `tpassenger` where `tpassenger <= tbus`  
and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that  
bus. In addition, each bus has a capacity. If at the moment the bus  
arrives at the station there are more passengers waiting than its  
capacity  
`capacity`, only `capacity` passengers will use the bus.

Write a solutionÂ to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by `bus_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Buses table:
+--------+--------------+----------+
| bus_id | arrival_time | capacity |
+--------+--------------+----------+
| 1      | 2            | 1        |
| 2      | 4            | 10       |
| 3      | 7            | 2        |
+--------+--------------+----------+
Passengers table:
+--------------+--------------+
| passenger_id | arrival_time |
+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | 1            |
| 12           | 1            |
| 13           | 5            |
| 14           | 6            |
| 15           | 7            |
+--------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------+----------------+
| bus_id | passengers_cnt |
+--------+----------------+
| 1      | 1              |
| 2      | 1              |
| 3      | 2              |
+--------+----------------+
Explanation:
- Passenger 11 arrives at time 1.
- Passenger 12 arrives at time 1.
- Bus 1 arrives at time 2 and collects passenger 11 as it has one empty seat.

- Bus 2 arrives at time 4 and collects passenger 12 as it has ten empty seats.

- Passenger 12 arrives at time 5.
- Passenger 13 arrives at time 6.
- Passenger 14 arrives at time 7.
- Bus 3 arrives at time 7 and collects passengers 12 and 13 as it has two empty seats.
```

I'll solve this advanced SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Determine how many passengers each bus picks up, considering bus capacity
2. A passenger can use a bus if they arrived at or before the bus
3. A passenger can only use the earliest available bus after they arrive
4. If more passengers are waiting than the bus capacity, only the earliest arriving passengers (up to capacity) will get on
5. Return the count of passengers per bus, sorted by bus_id

This is more complex than the previous problem because we need to handle bus capacity limits.

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Order passengers and buses by arrival time

First, we need to establish the order of arrivals for both buses and passengers:

```SQL
WITH OrderedBuses AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        arrival_time,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS bus_order
    FROM Buses
),
OrderedPassengers AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        arrival_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS passenger_order
    FROM Passengers
)
```

Explanation: We create two temporary tables with arrival order information. This helps us track the sequence of arrivals.

## Step 2: Determine which passengers are waiting for each bus

We need to identify all passengers who are waiting at the station when a bus arrives:

```SQL
WITH OrderedBuses AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        arrival_time,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS bus_order
    FROM Buses
),
OrderedPassengers AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        arrival_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS passenger_order
    FROM Passengers
),
WaitingPassengers AS (
    SELECT
        b.bus_id,
        b.arrival_time AS bus_arrival,
        b.capacity,
        p.passenger_id,
        p.arrival_time AS passenger_arrival,
        p.passenger_order
    FROM OrderedBuses b
    JOIN OrderedPassengers p ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
)
```

Explanation: This joins the passengers with buses where passengers arrived at or before the bus.

## Step 3: Track which passengers have already boarded previous buses

```SQL
WITH OrderedBuses AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        arrival_time,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS bus_order
    FROM Buses
),
OrderedPassengers AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        arrival_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS passenger_order
    FROM Passengers
),
BusPassengerEligibility AS (
    SELECT
        b.bus_id,
        b.bus_order,
        b.arrival_time AS bus_arrival,
        b.capacity,
        p.passenger_id,
        p.arrival_time AS passenger_arrival,
        p.passenger_order,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY p.passenger_id
            ORDER BY b.arrival_time
        ) AS passenger_bus_priority
    FROM OrderedBuses b
    JOIN OrderedPassengers p ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
)
```

Explanation: For each passenger, we rank the buses they could potentially board based on arrival time. The first bus (passenger_bus_priority = 1) is the one they would actually use.

## Step 4: Apply capacity constraints and count passengers per bus

```SQL
WITH OrderedBuses AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        arrival_time,
        capacity,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS bus_order
    FROM Buses
),
OrderedPassengers AS (
    SELECT
        passenger_id,
        arrival_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY arrival_time) AS passenger_order
    FROM Passengers
),
BusPassengerEligibility AS (
    SELECT
        b.bus_id,
        b.bus_order,
        b.arrival_time AS bus_arrival,
        b.capacity,
        p.passenger_id,
        p.arrival_time AS passenger_arrival,
        p.passenger_order,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY p.passenger_id
            ORDER BY b.arrival_time
        ) AS passenger_bus_priority
    FROM OrderedBuses b
    JOIN OrderedPassengers p ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
),
PassengerAssignments AS (
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        passenger_id
    FROM BusPassengerEligibility
    WHERE passenger_bus_priority = 1
),
RemainingCapacity AS (
    SELECT
        b.bus_id,
        b.bus_order,
        b.capacity,
        COUNT(pa.passenger_id) AS passengers_available,
        b.capacity - COALESCE(LAG(COUNT(pa.passenger_id)) OVER (ORDER BY b.bus_order), 0) AS remaining_capacity
    FROM OrderedBuses b
    LEFT JOIN PassengerAssignments pa ON b.bus_id = pa.bus_id
    GROUP BY b.bus_id, b.bus_order, b.capacity
)
```

Explanation: Here we're trying to calculate how many passengers are available for each bus and how much capacity remains.

## Final Solution:

Let's take a different approach that's more clear and aligned with the problem statement:

```SQL
WITH PassengerQueue AS (
    -- Track which passengers are waiting and for which bus
    SELECT
        p.passenger_id,
        p.arrival_time,
        MIN(b.bus_id) AS first_available_bus,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY p.arrival_time, p.passenger_id) AS queue_position
    FROM
        Passengers p
    JOIN
        Buses b ON p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    GROUP BY
        p.passenger_id, p.arrival_time
),
BusPassengers AS (
    -- For each bus, determine which passengers can board based on capacity
    SELECT
        b.bus_id,
        b.arrival_time,
        b.capacity,
        pq.passenger_id,
        pq.queue_position,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY b.bus_id
            ORDER BY pq.arrival_time, pq.passenger_id
        ) AS boarding_order
    FROM
        Buses b
    JOIN
        PassengerQueue pq ON b.bus_id = pq.first_available_bus
    WHERE
        NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM PassengerQueue pq2
            JOIN Buses b2 ON pq2.first_available_bus = b2.bus_id
            WHERE pq2.passenger_id = pq.passenger_id
            AND b2.arrival_time < b.arrival_time
        )
),
BoardedPassengers AS (
    -- Only include passengers who can board (within capacity)
    SELECT
        bus_id,
        passenger_id
    FROM
        BusPassengers
    WHERE
        boarding_order <= capacity
)

-- Count passengers per bus
SELECT
    b.bus_id,
    COUNT(bp.passenger_id) AS passengers_cnt
FROM
    Buses b
LEFT JOIN
    BoardedPassengers bp ON b.bus_id = bp.bus_id
GROUP BY
    b.bus_id
ORDER BY
    b.bus_id;
```

This solution:

1. Creates a queue of passengers, identifying the first available bus for each
2. Determines the boarding order for each bus based on passenger arrival time
3. Applies capacity constraints by only including passengers with boarding_order <= capacity
4. Counts passengers per bus, ensuring all buses are in the result with a LEFT JOIN
5. Orders by bus_id as required

The approach handles all the complexities of the problem including capacity constraints and ensuring passengers board the earliest possible bus.
