**Description**

Table: `Points`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each point is represented as a 2D coordinate (x_value, y_value).
```

Write a solution to report all possible **axis-aligned** rectangles with a **non-zero area** that can be formed by any two points from the `Points` table.

Each row in the result should contain three columns `(p1, p2, area)` where:

- `p1` and `p2` are the `id`'s of the two points that determine the opposite corners of a rectangle.
- `area` is the area of the rectangle and must be **non-zero**.

Return the result table **ordered** by `area` **in descending order**. If there is a tie, order them by `p1` **in ascending order**. If there is still a tie, order them by `p2` **in ascending order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following table.

Explanation:
The rectangle formed by p1 = 2 and p2 = 3 has an area equal to |4-2| * |8-10| = 4.
The rectangle formed by p1 = 1 and p2 = 2 has an area equal to |2-4| * |7-8| = 2.
Note that the rectangle formed by p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 is invalid because the area is 0.
```

## Solutions

I'll write a solution to find all possible axis-aligned rectangles with non-zero area that can be formed by any two points from the Points table.

For this problem, we need to:

1. Find all pairs of points that can form the opposite corners of a rectangle
2. Calculate the area of each rectangle
3. Filter out rectangles with zero area
4. Order the results by area (descending), p1 (ascending), and p2 (ascending)

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    p1.id AS p1,
    p2.id AS p2,
    ABS(p1.x_value - p2.x_value) * ABS(p1.y_value - p2.y_value) AS area
FROM
    Points p1
JOIN
    Points p2 ON p1.id < p2.id
WHERE
    p1.x_value != p2.x_value AND p1.y_value != p2.y_value
ORDER BY
    area DESC,
    p1 ASC,
    p2 ASC;
```

Let me explain this solution:

1. We use a self-join on the Points table to get all pairs of distinct points (p1, p2)
2. The condition `p1.id < p2.id` ensures we don't get duplicate pairs (like (1,2) and (2,1))
3. For a valid rectangle with non-zero area, both x and y coordinates must be different, which is enforced by the WHERE clause
4. The area is calculated as the product of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates
5. Results are ordered by area (descending), then p1 (ascending), and finally p2 (ascending)

For the example data:

- Points 1 (2,7) and 2 (4,8): |2-4| * |7-8| = 2 * 1 = 2
- Points 1 (2,7) and 3 (2,10): |2-2| * |7-10| = 0 * 3 = 0 (excluded as area is zero)
- Points 2 (4,8) and 3 (2,10): |4-2| * |8-10| = 2 * 2 = 4

So the output has two rows with areas 4 and 2, which is consistent with the expected result.
