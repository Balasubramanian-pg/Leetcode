**Description**

Table: `EmployeeShifts`

```Plain
+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     |
+------------------+----------+
| employee_id      | int      |
| start_time       | datetime |
| end_time         | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
(employee_id, start_time) is the unique key for this table.
This table contains information about the shifts worked by employees, including the start time, and end time.
```

Write a solution to analyze overlapping shifts for each employee. Two shifts are considered overlapping if they occur on the **same date** and one shift's `end_time` is **later than** another shift's `start_time`.

For **each employee**, calculate the following:

1. The **maximum** number of shifts that **overlap** at any **given time**.
2. The **total duration** of all overlaps in minutes.

_Return the result table ordered by_ `employee_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`EmployeeShifts` table:

```Plain
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| employee_id | start_time          | end_time            |
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1           | 2023-10-01 09:00:00 | 2023-10-01 17:00:00 |
| 1           | 2023-10-01 15:00:00 | 2023-10-01 23:00:00 |
| 1           | 2023-10-01 16:00:00 | 2023-10-02 00:00:00 |
| 2           | 2023-10-01 09:00:00 | 2023-10-01 17:00:00 |
| 2           | 2023-10-01 11:00:00 | 2023-10-01 19:00:00 |
| 3           | 2023-10-01 09:00:00 | 2023-10-01 17:00:00 |
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+---------------------------+------------------------+
| employee_id | max_overlapping_shifts    | total_overlap_duration |
+-------------+---------------------------+------------------------+
| 1           | 3                         | 600                    |
| 2           | 2                         | 360                    |
| 3           | 1                         | 0                      |
+-------------+---------------------------+------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Employee 1 has 3 shifts: The maximum number of overlapping shifts is 3 (from 16:00 to 17:00).  
    The total overlap duration is: - 2 hours (15:00-17:00) between 1st and  
    2nd shifts - 1 hour (16:00-17:00) between 1st and 3rd shifts - 7 hours  
    (16:00-23:00) between 2nd and 3rd shifts Total: 10 hours = 600 minutes  
    - 2023-10-01 09:00:00 to 2023-10-01 17:00:00
    - 2023-10-01 15:00:00 to 2023-10-01 23:00:00
    - 2023-10-01 16:00:00 to 2023-10-02 00:00:00
- Employee 2 has 2 shifts: The maximum number of overlapping shifts is 2. The total overlap duration is 6 hours (11:00-17:00) = 360 minutes.
    - 2023-10-01 09:00:00 to 2023-10-01 17:00:00
    - 2023-10-01 11:00:00 to 2023-10-01 19:00:00
- Employee 3 has only 1 shift, so there are no overlaps.

The output table contains the employee_id, the maximum  
number of simultaneous overlaps, and the total overlap duration in  
minutes for each employee, ordered by employee_id in ascending order.  

## Solutions

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Identify **overlapping shifts** for each employee on the **same date**.
2. Calculate:
    - The **maximum number of shifts** that overlap at any given time.
    - The **total duration of all overlaps** in minutes.
3. Return the result ordered by `employee_id` in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Two shifts overlap if they are on the same date and one shift’s `end_time` is later than another shift’s `start_time`.
- Use window functions to analyze overlaps and calculate durations.

---

### **Step 2: Extract Date and Calculate Overlaps**

First, extract the date from `start_time` and `end_time`, and identify overlapping shifts for each employee.

```SQL
WITH ShiftDates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        DATE(start_time) AS shift_date,
        start_time,
        end_time
    FROM
        EmployeeShifts
),
OverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        a.employee_id,
        a.shift_date,
        a.start_time AS shift1_start,
        a.end_time AS shift1_end,
        b.start_time AS shift2_start,
        b.end_time AS shift2_end,
        CASE
            WHEN a.end_time > b.start_time AND a.start_time < b.end_time THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_overlapping
    FROM
        ShiftDates a
    JOIN
        ShiftDates b
    ON
        a.employee_id = b.employee_id
        AND a.shift_date = b.shift_date
        AND a.start_time < b.start_time
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**ShiftDates**` **CTE**: Extracts the date from `start_time` and `end_time`.
- `**OverlappingShifts**` **CTE**:
    - Joins the table to itself to compare shifts on the same date.
    - Uses a `CASE` statement to mark shifts as overlapping (`1`) or not (`0`).

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Maximum Overlapping Shifts**

Next, calculate the maximum number of overlapping shifts for each employee at any given time.

```SQL
, MaxOverlaps AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        shift_date,
        SUM(is_overlapping) AS overlapping_count
    FROM
        OverlappingShifts
    GROUP BY
        employee_id, shift_date
),
MaxOverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        MAX(overlapping_count) AS max_overlapping_shifts
    FROM
        MaxOverlaps
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**MaxOverlaps**` **CTE**: Sums the overlapping shifts for each employee on each date.
- `**MaxOverlappingShifts**` **CTE**: Finds the maximum number of overlapping shifts across all dates for each employee.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Total Overlap Duration**

Now, calculate the total duration of all overlaps in minutes for each employee.

```SQL
, OverlapDurations AS (
    SELECT
        a.employee_id,
        a.shift_date,
        GREATEST(a.start_time, b.start_time) AS overlap_start,
        LEAST(a.end_time, b.end_time) AS overlap_end,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, GREATEST(a.start_time, b.start_time), LEAST(a.end_time, b.end_time)) AS overlap_duration
    FROM
        ShiftDates a
    JOIN
        ShiftDates b
    ON
        a.employee_id = b.employee_id
        AND a.shift_date = b.shift_date
        AND a.end_time > b.start_time
        AND a.start_time < b.end_time
),
TotalOverlapDuration AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        SUM(overlap_duration) AS total_overlap_duration
    FROM
        OverlapDurations
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**OverlapDurations**` **CTE**: Calculates the duration of each overlap in minutes using `TIMESTAMPDIFF`.
- `**TotalOverlapDuration**` **CTE**: Sums the overlap durations for each employee.

---

### **Step 5: Combine Results**

Finally, combine the maximum overlapping shifts and total overlap duration into a single result table.

```SQL
SELECT
    mos.employee_id,
    mos.max_overlapping_shifts,
    COALESCE(tod.total_overlap_duration, 0) AS total_overlap_duration
FROM
    MaxOverlappingShifts mos
LEFT JOIN
    TotalOverlapDuration tod ON mos.employee_id = tod.employee_id
ORDER BY
    mos.employee_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**LEFT JOIN**`: Ensures all employees are included, even if they have no overlaps.
- `**COALESCE**`: Replaces `NULL` values with `0` for employees with no overlaps.
- `**ORDER BY**`: Orders the result by `employee_id` in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH ShiftDates AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        DATE(start_time) AS shift_date,
        start_time,
        end_time
    FROM
        EmployeeShifts
),
OverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        a.employee_id,
        a.shift_date,
        a.start_time AS shift1_start,
        a.end_time AS shift1_end,
        b.start_time AS shift2_start,
        b.end_time AS shift2_end,
        CASE
            WHEN a.end_time > b.start_time AND a.start_time < b.end_time THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS is_overlapping
    FROM
        ShiftDates a
    JOIN
        ShiftDates b
    ON
        a.employee_id = b.employee_id
        AND a.shift_date = b.shift_date
        AND a.start_time < b.start_time
),
MaxOverlaps AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        shift_date,
        SUM(is_overlapping) AS overlapping_count
    FROM
        OverlappingShifts
    GROUP BY
        employee_id, shift_date
),
MaxOverlappingShifts AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        MAX(overlapping_count) AS max_overlapping_shifts
    FROM
        MaxOverlaps
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
),
OverlapDurations AS (
    SELECT
        a.employee_id,
        a.shift_date,
        GREATEST(a.start_time, b.start_time) AS overlap_start,
        LEAST(a.end_time, b.end_time) AS overlap_end,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, GREATEST(a.start_time, b.start_time), LEAST(a.end_time, b.end_time)) AS overlap_duration
    FROM
        ShiftDates a
    JOIN
        ShiftDates b
    ON
        a.employee_id = b.employee_id
        AND a.shift_date = b.shift_date
        AND a.end_time > b.start_time
        AND a.start_time < b.end_time
),
TotalOverlapDuration AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        SUM(overlap_duration) AS total_overlap_duration
    FROM
        OverlapDurations
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
)
SELECT
    mos.employee_id,
    mos.max_overlapping_shifts,
    COALESCE(tod.total_overlap_duration, 0) AS total_overlap_duration
FROM
    MaxOverlappingShifts mos
LEFT JOIN
    TotalOverlapDuration tod ON mos.employee_id = tod.employee_id
ORDER BY
    mos.employee_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Overlap Identification**: Identifies overlapping shifts on the same date.
3. **Maximum Overlaps**: Calculates the maximum number of overlapping shifts.
4. **Overlap Duration**: Computes the total duration of all overlaps in minutes.
5. **Final Join**: Combines all metrics into a single result table.
6. **Ordering**: Sorts the result by `employee_id` in ascending order.

This query returns the desired output, listing each employee’s ID, the maximum number of overlapping shifts, and the total overlap duration in minutes.
