Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.
```

Write a solutionÂ to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output:
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```

# Finding Employees Who Earn More Than Their Managers

To solve this problem, I need to find employees whose salary is higher than their manager's salary. The key is to join the Employee table with itself to compare each employee's salary with their manager's salary.

## Approach

1. **Self-Join**: We'll join the Employee table with itself. One instance will represent the employees (let's call it `e`), and the other will represent their managers (`m`).
2. **Join Condition**: The join condition will be `e.managerId = m.id`, which links each employee to their manager.
3. **Filtering**: After the join, we'll filter for rows where `e.salary > m.salary`.
4. **Selecting Result**: Finally, we'll select only the employee names from the filtered results.

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
JOIN Employee m ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary;
```

## Explanation

- The query starts by selecting the `name` column from the Employee table (aliased as `e`), which represents employees.
- It then joins this table with another instance of the Employee table (aliased as `m`), which represents managers. The join condition `e.managerId = m.id` ensures that each employee is matched with their respective manager.
- The WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the employee's salary (`e.salary`) is greater than their manager's salary (`m.salary`).
- The result is a list of employee names who earn more than their managers, which in the example is just "Joe".

This approach efficiently identifies the desired employees by leveraging a self-join to compare salaries between employees and their managers directly.
