**Description**

Table: `Rides`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| ride_id      | int  |
| driver_id    | int  |
| passenger_id | int  |
+--------------+------+
ride_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of the driver and the ID of the passenger that rode in ride_id.
Note that driver_id != passenger_id.
```

Write a solutionÂ to report the ID of each driver and the number of times they were a passenger.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Rides table:
+---------+-----------+--------------+
| ride_id | driver_id | passenger_id |
+---------+-----------+--------------+
| 1       | 7         | 1            |
| 2       | 7         | 2            |
| 3       | 11        | 1            |
| 4       | 11        | 7            |
| 5       | 11        | 7            |
| 6       | 11        | 3            |
+---------+-----------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+-----+
| driver_id | cnt |
+-----------+-----+
| 7         | 2   |
| 11        | 0   |
+-----------+-----+
Explanation:
There are two drivers in all the given rides: 7 and 11.
The driver with ID = 7 was a passenger two times.
The driver with ID = 11 was never a passenger.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find each driver and count how many times they were a passenger in other rides. We need to:

1. Identify all unique drivers
2. Count how many times each driver appears as a passenger
3. Return each driver with their passenger count

## Step 1: Start with finding all unique drivers

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT driver_id
FROM Rides
```

Explanation: We begin by identifying all the unique drivers in the Rides table. This ensures we include all drivers in our result.

## Step 2: Count how many times each driver was a passenger

```SQL
SELECT driver_id, COUNT(ride_id) AS cnt
FROM Rides
WHERE passenger_id = driver_id
GROUP BY driver_id
```

Explanation: This attempt won't work correctly. We need to look at all records where the driver_id appears as a passenger_id in other rides, not in the same ride (the problem notes that driver_id != passenger_id).

## Step 3: Refactor our approach using a LEFT JOIN

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT r1.driver_id,
       COUNT(r2.ride_id) AS cnt
FROM Rides r1
LEFT JOIN Rides r2 ON r1.driver_id = r2.passenger_id
GROUP BY r1.driver_id
```

Explanation: We use a LEFT JOIN to join the Rides table with itself. For each driver, we join with all rides where that driver is a passenger. The LEFT JOIN ensures we include drivers who were never passengers.

## Step 4: Fix the counting to avoid NULL values

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT r1.driver_id,
       COUNT(r2.ride_id) AS cnt
FROM Rides r1
LEFT JOIN Rides r2 ON r1.driver_id = r2.passenger_id
GROUP BY r1.driver_id
```

Explanation: When we use COUNT with a LEFT JOIN, NULL values (from drivers who were never passengers) are automatically excluded from the count. This gives us the correct result.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT r1.driver_id,
       COUNT(r2.ride_id) AS cnt
FROM Rides r1
LEFT JOIN Rides r2 ON r1.driver_id = r2.passenger_id
GROUP BY r1.driver_id
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Selects all unique drivers from the Rides table
2. For each driver, it counts how many times they appear as a passenger in other rides
3. The LEFT JOIN ensures we include drivers who were never passengers (they will have a count of 0)
4. The GROUP BY groups the results by driver_id
5. The DISTINCT keyword ensures we don't count the same driver multiple times if they drove multiple rides

Looking at the example data:

- Driver 7 appears as a passenger in rides 4 and 5, so their count is 2
- Driver 11 never appears as a passenger, so their count is 0

This matches the expected output.
