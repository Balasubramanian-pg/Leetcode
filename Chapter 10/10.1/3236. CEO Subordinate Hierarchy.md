**Description**

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
| salary        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the unique identifier for this table.
manager_id is the employee_id of the employee's manager. The CEO has a NULL manager_id.
```

Write a solution to find subordinates of the CEO (both **direct** and **indirect**), along with their **level in the hierarchy** and their **salary difference** from the CEO.

The result should have the following columns:

The query result format is in the following example.

- `subordinate_id`: The employee_id of the subordinate
- `subordinate_name`: The name of the subordinate
- `hierarchy_level`: The level of the subordinate in the hierarchy (`1` for **direct** reports, `2` for **their direct** reports, and **so on**)
- `salary_difference`: The difference between the subordinate's salary and the CEO's salary

Return _the result table ordered by_ `hierarchy_level` _**ascending**_, _and then by_ `subordinate_id` _**ascending**_.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Employees` table:

```Plain
+-------------+----------------+------------+---------+
| employee_id | employee_name  | manager_id | salary  |
+-------------+----------------+------------+---------+
| 1           | Alice          | NULL       | 150000  |
| 2           | Bob            | 1          | 120000  |
| 3           | Charlie        | 1          | 110000  |
| 4           | David          | 2          | 105000  |
| 5           | Eve            | 2          | 100000  |
| 6           | Frank          | 3          | 95000   |
| 7           | Grace          | 3          | 98000   |
| 8           | Helen          | 5          | 90000   |
+-------------+----------------+------------+---------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| subordinate_id | subordinate_name | hierarchy_level  | salary_difference |
+----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
| 2              | Bob              | 1                | -30000            |
| 3              | Charlie          | 1                | -40000            |
| 4              | David            | 2                | -45000            |
| 5              | Eve              | 2                | -50000            |
| 6              | Frank            | 2                | -55000            |
| 7              | Grace            | 2                | -52000            |
| 8              | Helen            | 3                | -60000            |
+----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Bob and Charlie are direct subordinates of Alice (CEO) and thus have a hierarchy_level of 1.
- David and Eve report to Bob, while Frank and Grace report to Charlie, making them second-level subordinates (hierarchy_level 2).
- Helen reports to Eve, making Helen a third-level subordinate (hierarchy_level 3).
- Salary differences are calculated relative to Alice's salary of 150000.
- The result is ordered by hierarchy_level ascending, and then by subordinate_id ascending.

**Note:** The output is ordered first by hierarchy_level in ascending order, then by subordinate_id in ascending order.

  

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find:

1. **Subordinates** of the CEO (both direct and indirect).
2. Their **hierarchy level** (1 for direct reports, 2 for their direct reports, etc.).
3. Their **salary difference** from the CEO.

**Key Points:**

- Identify the CEO (the employee with `manager_id = NULL`).
- Use recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to traverse the hierarchy.
- Calculate the salary difference from the CEO’s salary.

---

### **Step 2: Identify the CEO**

First, find the CEO’s `employee_id` and `salary`.

```SQL
WITH CEO AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id AS ceo_id,
        salary AS ceo_salary
    FROM
        Employees
    WHERE
        manager_id IS NULL
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CEO**` **CTE**: Selects the CEO’s ID and salary by filtering for `manager_id IS NULL`.

---

### **Step 3: Traverse the Hierarchy Recursively**

Use a recursive CTE to traverse the hierarchy and determine the level of each subordinate.

```SQL
, Hierarchy AS (
    SELECT
        e.employee_id AS subordinate_id,
        e.employee_name AS subordinate_name,
        1 AS hierarchy_level,
        e.manager_id
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        CEO c ON e.manager_id = c.ceo_id

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.employee_name,
        h.hierarchy_level + 1,
        e.manager_id
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        Hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.subordinate_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: Selects direct subordinates of the CEO with `hierarchy_level = 1`.
- **Recursive Case**: Joins the `Hierarchy` CTE with itself to find subordinates of subordinates, incrementing the `hierarchy_level` by 1.
- `**UNION ALL**`: Combines the base and recursive cases.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Salary Difference**

Finally, calculate the salary difference from the CEO’s salary.

```SQL
SELECT
    h.subordinate_id,
    h.subordinate_name,
    h.hierarchy_level,
    (c.ceo_salary - e.salary) AS salary_difference
FROM
    Hierarchy h
JOIN
    Employees e ON h.subordinate_id = e.employee_id
CROSS JOIN
    CEO c
ORDER BY
    h.hierarchy_level ASC, h.subordinate_id ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CROSS JOIN CEO**`: Ensures the CEO’s salary is available for all rows.
- `**salary_difference**`: Calculates the difference between the CEO’s salary and the subordinate’s salary.
- `**ORDER BY**`: Orders the result by `hierarchy_level` ascending, then by `subordinate_id` ascending.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH CEO AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id AS ceo_id,
        salary AS ceo_salary
    FROM
        Employees
    WHERE
        manager_id IS NULL
),
Hierarchy AS (
    SELECT
        e.employee_id AS subordinate_id,
        e.employee_name AS subordinate_name,
        1 AS hierarchy_level,
        e.manager_id
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        CEO c ON e.manager_id = c.ceo_id

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.employee_name,
        h.hierarchy_level + 1,
        e.manager_id
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        Hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.subordinate_id
)
SELECT
    h.subordinate_id,
    h.subordinate_name,
    h.hierarchy_level,
    (c.ceo_salary - e.salary) AS salary_difference
FROM
    Hierarchy h
JOIN
    Employees e ON h.subordinate_id = e.employee_id
CROSS JOIN
    CEO c
ORDER BY
    h.hierarchy_level ASC, h.subordinate_id ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **CEO Identification**: Finds the CEO’s ID and salary.
3. **Recursive Hierarchy**: Traverses the hierarchy to determine subordinate levels.
4. **Salary Difference**: Calculates the difference from the CEO’s salary.
5. **Ordering**: Sorts the result by hierarchy level and subordinate ID.

This query returns the desired output, listing subordinates of the CEO along with their hierarchy level and salary difference from the CEO.
