**Description**

Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
```

Write a solution to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the `Customers` table but are in the range between `1` and the **maximum** `customer_id` present in the table.

**Notice** that the maximum `customer_id` will not exceed `100`.

Return the result table ordered by `ids` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
Output:
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Explanation:
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.
```

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

- We need to find customer IDs that are missing between 1 and the maximum customer ID
- The maximum ID won't exceed 100
- Results should be ordered from smallest to largest

### Step 2: Create a Sequence of Numbers

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE t AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 100
)
```

- This creates a table "t" with numbers from 1 to 100
- We start with the number 1
- Then we keep adding numbers (n + 1) until we reach 100
- This gives us ALL possible IDs we might need

### Step 3: Find the Maximum Customer ID

```SQL
SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers
```

- This finds the largest customer ID in our table
- In the example, this would return 5

## Step 4: Filter Numbers Up to Maximum ID

```SQL
WHERE n < (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers)
```

- We only want numbers up to the maximum ID
- This narrows our sequence from Step 2
- In the example, we now have numbers 1 through 4

## Step 5: Remove Existing Customer IDs

```SQL
AND n NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers)
```

- This removes numbers that already exist as customer IDs
- In the example, it removes 1 and 4, leaving only 2 and 3

## Step 6: Select and Name the Result Column

```SQL
SELECT n AS ids
```

- We select the remaining numbers from our filtered sequence
- We rename the column to "ids" as required

## Complete Solution

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE t AS (
    SELECT 1 AS n
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM t WHERE n < 100
)
SELECT n AS ids
FROM t
WHERE n < (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers)
AND n NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers)
ORDER BY ids;
```

This solution generates all numbers from 1 to the maximum customer ID, then removes the IDs that already exist in the Customers table, leaving only the missing IDs.
