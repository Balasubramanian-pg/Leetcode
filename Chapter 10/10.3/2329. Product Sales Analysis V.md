**Description**

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| user_id     | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
sale_id contains unique values.
product_id is a foreign key (column with unique values) toProduct table.
Each row of this table shows the ID of the product and the quantity purchased by a user.
```

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
product_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table indicates the price of each product.
```

Write a solution to reportÂ the spending of each user.

Return the resulting table ordered by `spending` in **descending order**. In case of a tie, order them by `user_id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| sale_id | product_id | user_id | quantity |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1       | 1          | 101     | 10       |
| 2       | 2          | 101     | 1        |
| 3       | 3          | 102     | 3        |
| 4       | 3          | 102     | 2        |
| 5       | 2          | 103     | 3        |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 10    |
| 2          | 25    |
| 3          | 15    |
+------------+-------+
Output:
+---------+----------+
| user_id | spending |
+---------+----------+
| 101     | 125      |
| 102     | 75       |
| 103     | 75       |
+---------+----------+
Explanation:
User 101 spent 10 * 10 + 1 * 25 = 125.
User 102 spent 3 * 15 + 2 * 15 = 75.
User 103 spent 3 * 25 = 75.
Users 102 and 103 spent the same amount and we break the tie by their ID while user 101 is on the top.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to calculate the total spending of each user
-- Spending = sum of (quantity * price) for all products purchased by the user
-- Results should be ordered by spending in descending order
-- In case of a tie in spending, order by user_id in ascending order
```

Explanation: This problem asks us to calculate how much each user spent in total across all their purchases, and then return the results ordered first by spending (highest to lowest) and then by user_id (lowest to highest) in case of ties.

Step 2: Join the Sales and Product Tables

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    s.quantity,
    p.price
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
```

Explanation: First, we need to join the Sales and Product tables to get the price for each product purchased. This gives us all the necessary data to calculate spending for each sale.

Step 3: Calculate the Spending for Each Sale

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    s.quantity * p.price as sale_amount
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
```

Explanation: For each sale, we calculate the amount spent by multiplying the quantity by the price of the product.

Step 4: Group by User to Calculate Total Spending

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as spending
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
```

Explanation: Now we group the results by user_id and sum up all the sale amounts to get the total spending for each user.

Step 5: Order the Results as Required

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as spending
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
ORDER BY spending DESC, s.user_id ASC
```

Explanation: Finally, we order the results by spending in descending order (highest first), and in case of a tie, by user_id in ascending order (lowest first).

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as spending
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.user_id
ORDER BY spending DESC, s.user_id ASC
```

Explanation: This query:

1. Joins the Sales and Product tables to get the price for each product
2. Calculates the spending for each purchase by multiplying quantity by price
3. Groups the results by user_id to get total spending per user
4. Orders the results by spending in descending order, and then by user_id in ascending order in case of ties

The final result shows each user's total spending, ordered as required by the problem.
