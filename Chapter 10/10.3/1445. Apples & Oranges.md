**Description**

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| sale_date     | date    |
| fruit         | enum    |
| sold_num      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(sale_date, fruit) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
```

Write a solution to report the difference between the number of **apples** and **oranges** sold each day.

Return the result table **ordered** by `sale_date`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation:
Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).
```

I'll write a solution to calculate the difference between apples and oranges sold each day.

The problem requires us to:

1. Calculate how many apples and oranges were sold on each day
2. Find the difference (apples - oranges) for each day
3. Order the results by sale_date

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    sale_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fruit = 'apples' THEN sold_num ELSE -sold_num END) AS diff
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    sale_date
ORDER BY
    sale_date;
```

This solution:

1. Groups the data by sale_date
2. Uses a CASE expression within SUM to:
    - Add the sold_num when the fruit is 'apples'
    - Subtract the sold_num when the fruit is 'oranges' (by adding a negative value)
3. Orders the results by sale_date

Alternative approach using conditional aggregation:

```SQL
SELECT
    sale_date,
    SUM(IF(fruit = 'apples', sold_num, 0)) -
    SUM(IF(fruit = 'oranges', sold_num, 0)) AS diff
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY
    sale_date
ORDER BY
    sale_date;
```

This alternative:

1. Separately sums the number of apples and oranges sold each day
2. Calculates the difference between these sums
3. Orders by sale_date

Both solutions produce the correct result showing the daily difference between apple and orange sales.
