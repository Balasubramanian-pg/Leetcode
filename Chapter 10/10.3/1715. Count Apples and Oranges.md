**Description**

Table: `Boxes`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| box_id       | int  |
| chest_id     | int  |
| apple_count  | int  |
| orange_count | int  |
+--------------+------+
box_id is the column with unique values for this table.
chest_id is a foreign key (reference column) of the chests table.
This table contains information about the boxes and the number of oranges and apples they have. Each box may include a chest, which also can contain oranges and apples.
```

Table: `Chests`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| chest_id     | int  |
| apple_count  | int  |
| orange_count | int  |
+--------------+------+
chest_id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the chests and the corresponding number of oranges and apples they have.
```

Write a solution to count the number of apples and oranges  
in all the boxes. If a box contains a chest, you should also include  
the number of apples and oranges it has.  

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Boxes table:
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
| box_id | chest_id | apple_count | orange_count |
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
| 2      | null     | 6           | 15           |
| 18     | 14       | 4           | 15           |
| 19     | 3        | 8           | 4            |
| 12     | 2        | 19          | 20           |
| 20     | 6        | 12          | 9            |
| 8      | 6        | 9           | 9            |
| 3      | 14       | 16          | 7            |
+--------+----------+-------------+--------------+
Chests table:
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| chest_id | apple_count | orange_count |
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| 6        | 5           | 6            |
| 14       | 20          | 10           |
| 2        | 8           | 8            |
| 3        | 19          | 4            |
| 16       | 19          | 19           |
+----------+-------------+--------------+
Output:
+-------------+--------------+
| apple_count | orange_count |
+-------------+--------------+
| 151         | 123          |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
box 2 has 6 apples and 15 oranges.
box 18 has 4 + 20 (from the chest) = 24 apples and 15 + 10 (from the chest) = 25 oranges.
box 19 has 8 + 19 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 4 + 4 (from the chest) = 8 oranges.
box 12 has 19 + 8 (from the chest) = 27 apples and 20 + 8 (from the chest) = 28 oranges.
box 20 has 12 + 5 (from the chest) = 17 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 8 has 9 + 5 (from the chest) = 14 apples and 9 + 6 (from the chest) = 15 oranges.
box 3 has 16 + 20 (from the chest) = 36 apples and 7 + 10 (from the chest) = 17 oranges.
Total number of apples = 6 + 24 + 27 + 27 + 17 + 14 + 36 = 151
Total number of oranges = 15 + 25 + 8 + 28 + 15 + 15 + 17 = 123
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to calculate the total number of apples and oranges in all boxes. If a box contains a chest, we also need to include the fruits in that chest in our count.

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Start with a left join of Boxes and Chests

```SQL
SELECT
    b.box_id,
    b.chest_id,
    b.apple_count AS box_apples,
    b.orange_count AS box_oranges,
    c.apple_count AS chest_apples,
    c.orange_count AS chest_oranges
FROM
    Boxes b
LEFT JOIN
    Chests c ON b.chest_id = c.chest_id;
```

Explanation: This gives us all boxes with their corresponding chest information. We use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that boxes without chests are still included in the result.

### Step 2: Calculate the total fruits for each box

```SQL
SELECT
    b.box_id,
    b.apple_count + COALESCE(c.apple_count, 0) AS total_apples,
    b.orange_count + COALESCE(c.orange_count, 0) AS total_oranges
FROM
    Boxes b
LEFT JOIN
    Chests c ON b.chest_id = c.chest_id;
```

Explanation: Now for each box, we're calculating the total number of apples and oranges by adding the fruits in the box and the fruits in the chest (if any). The COALESCE function ensures that if there's no chest (NULL values), we add 0 instead.

### Step 3: Sum up the totals across all boxes

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(b.apple_count + COALESCE(c.apple_count, 0)) AS apple_count,
    SUM(b.orange_count + COALESCE(c.orange_count, 0)) AS orange_count
FROM
    Boxes b
LEFT JOIN
    Chests c ON b.chest_id = c.chest_id;
```

Explanation: Finally, we sum up the total apples and oranges across all boxes to get our final result. This gives us the total number of each fruit type as required.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    SUM(b.apple_count + COALESCE(c.apple_count, 0)) AS apple_count,
    SUM(b.orange_count + COALESCE(c.orange_count, 0)) AS orange_count
FROM
    Boxes b
LEFT JOIN
    Chests c ON b.chest_id = c.chest_id;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution. We join the Boxes and Chests tables, calculate the total fruits for each box by adding the fruits in the box and in the chest (if any), and then sum up these totals across all boxes. The COALESCE function handles the case where a box doesn't have a chest by treating those missing values as 0.
