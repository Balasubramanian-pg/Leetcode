Table: `Products`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
```

Initially, all products have price 10.

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on the date `2019-08-16`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```

# Solution to Find Product Prices on 2019-08-16

To solve this problem, I need to find the price of each product as it was on 2019-08-16. If a product had no price change before or on that date, it should default to 10.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    COALESCE(
        (SELECT new_price
         FROM Products
         WHERE product_id = p.product_id AND change_date <= '2019-08-16'
         ORDER BY change_date DESC
         LIMIT 1),
        10
    ) AS price
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) p;
```

## Alternative Solution (Using LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY)

```SQL
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16' THEN p2.new_price END), 10) AS price
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) p
LEFT JOIN
    Products p2 ON p.product_id = p2.product_id AND p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
GROUP BY
    p.product_id;
```

## Explanation

1. We first get all distinct product_ids from the Products table
2. For each product, we find the most recent price change that occurred on or before 2019-08-16:
    - The subquery finds the latest price change date â‰¤ 2019-08-16 for each product
    - If no such record exists (product had no price changes before the date), we use the default price of 10 (handled by COALESCE)
3. The result shows each product_id with its price as it was on 2019-08-16

For the given example:

- Product 1 had a price change on 2019-08-16 (35) - this is the most recent before the target date
- Product 2's last change before 2019-08-16 was 50 (on 2019-08-14)
- Product 3 had no changes before 2019-08-16, so it defaults to 10

The output correctly shows these prices for each product.

  

# Explanation of `LIMIT 1` in the SQL Query

The `LIMIT 1` is used in the subquery to ensure we only get the most recent price change for each product before or on 2019-08-16. Here's why it's necessary:

## Detailed Explanation

1. **Ordering by date descending**:
    - `ORDER BY change_date DESC` puts the most recent changes first
    - Without `LIMIT 1`, the subquery would return all price changes before the date
2. **Getting just the most recent price**:
    - We only want the price that was active on 2019-08-16
    - This is always the most recent price change that happened on or before that date
    - `LIMIT 1` ensures we only get that single most recent record
3. **How it works with the example data**:
    - For product_id 1:
        - Without LIMIT: would return all three changes (2019-08-16, 2019-08-15, 2019-08-14)
        - With LIMIT 1: returns only the 2019-08-16 change (35)
    - For product_id 2:
        - Without LIMIT: would return two changes (2019-08-14, 2019-08-17 - but 2019-08-17 is excluded by WHERE)
        - With LIMIT 1: returns only the 2019-08-14 change (50)

## Alternative Without LIMIT

You could also write this without LIMIT using a different approach:

```SQL
SELECT p1.product_id,
       COALESCE(p1.new_price, 10) AS price
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products) all_products
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT p1.product_id, p1.new_price
    FROM Products p1
    JOIN (
        SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date) as max_date
        FROM Products
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
        GROUP BY product_id
    ) p2 ON p1.product_id = p2.product_id AND p1.change_date = p2.max_date
) p1 ON all_products.product_id = p1.product_id
```

But the `LIMIT 1` approach is more concise and efficient for this specific case where we just need the single most recent record.
