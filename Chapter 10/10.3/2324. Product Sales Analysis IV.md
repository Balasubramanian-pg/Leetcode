**Description**

Table: `Sales`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| user_id     | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
sale_id contains unique values.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) toProduct table.
Each row of this table shows the ID of the product and the quantity purchased by a user.
```

Table: `Product`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
product_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table indicates the price of each product.
```

Write a solution that reports for each user the product id  
on which the user spent the most money. In case the same user spent the  
most money on two or more products, report all of them.  

Return the resulting table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| sale_id | product_id | user_id | quantity |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
| 1       | 1          | 101     | 10       |
| 2       | 3          | 101     | 7        |
| 3       | 1          | 102     | 9        |
| 4       | 2          | 102     | 6        |
| 5       | 3          | 102     | 10       |
| 6       | 1          | 102     | 6        |
+---------+------------+---------+----------+
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 10    |
| 2          | 25    |
| 3          | 15    |
+------------+-------+
Output:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | product_id |
+---------+------------+
| 101     | 3          |
| 102     | 1          |
| 102     | 2          |
| 102     | 3          |
+---------+------------+
Explanation:
User 101:
    - Spent 10 * 10 = 100 on product 1.
    - Spent 7 * 15 = 105 on product 3.
User 101 spent the most money on product 3.
User 102:
    - Spent (9 + 6) * 10 = 150 on product 1.
    - Spent 6 * 25 = 150 on product 2.
    - Spent 10 * 15 = 150 on product 3.
User 102 spent the most money on products 1, 2, and 3.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to find which product(s) each user spent the most money on
-- Total spent = quantity * price
-- If a user spent the same maximum amount on multiple products, report all of them
```

Explanation: This problem requires calculating how much each user spent on each product (by multiplying quantity by price), finding the maximum amount spent per user, and returning all products that match this maximum amount for each user.

Step 2: Calculate Total Spent Per User Per Product

```SQL
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    s.product_id,
    SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_spent
FROM Sales s
JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.user_id, s.product_id
```

Explanation: First, we need to join the Sales and Product tables to get the price for each product. Then we calculate the total spent by multiplying quantity by price and summing it up for each user-product combination.

Step 3: Find Maximum Amount Spent Per User

```SQL
WITH UserProductSpend AS (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        s.product_id,
        SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_spent
    FROM Sales s
    JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY s.user_id, s.product_id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(total_spent) as max_spent
FROM UserProductSpend
GROUP BY user_id
```

Explanation: Using our previous calculation as a Common Table Expression (CTE), we can now find the maximum amount spent by each user across all products.

Step 4: Match Products with Maximum Spend

```SQL
WITH UserProductSpend AS (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        s.product_id,
        SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_spent
    FROM Sales s
    JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY s.user_id, s.product_id
),
UserMaxSpend AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MAX(total_spent) as max_spent
    FROM UserProductSpend
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    ups.user_id,
    ups.product_id
FROM UserProductSpend ups
JOIN UserMaxSpend ums ON ups.user_id = ums.user_id AND ups.total_spent = ums.max_spent
```

Explanation: Now we join our UserProductSpend CTE with the UserMaxSpend CTE to find all cases where a user's spending on a product matches their maximum spending amount. This gives us all products that each user spent the most money on.

Step 5: Final Solution

```SQL
WITH UserProductSpend AS (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        s.product_id,
        SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_spent
    FROM Sales s
    JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY s.user_id, s.product_id
),
UserMaxSpend AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        MAX(total_spent) as max_spent
    FROM UserProductSpend
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    ups.user_id,
    ups.product_id
FROM UserProductSpend ups
JOIN UserMaxSpend ums ON ups.user_id = ums.user_id AND ups.total_spent = ums.max_spent
ORDER BY ups.user_id
```

Explanation: The final solution builds on the previous steps. We first calculate the total spent by each user on each product. Then we find the maximum amount spent by each user. Finally, we join these two results to find all products where a user's spending matches their maximum spending amount. We add ORDER BY to make the output more readable, although the problem states that the result can be in any order.

Final Solution (Alternative with Window Functions):

```SQL
WITH UserProductSpend AS (
    SELECT
        s.user_id,
        s.product_id,
        SUM(s.quantity * p.price) as total_spent,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.user_id ORDER BY SUM(s.quantity * p.price) DESC) as spend_rank
    FROM Sales s
    JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY s.user_id, s.product_id
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    product_id
FROM UserProductSpend
WHERE spend_rank = 1
```

Explanation: This alternative solution uses window functions for a more concise approach. We calculate the total spent per user per product and assign a rank to each product within each user partition, ordered by total spent in descending order. Then we simply filter for records with rank = 1, which gives us all products with the highest spending for each user.
