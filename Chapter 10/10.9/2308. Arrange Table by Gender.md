**Description**

Table: `Genders`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| gender      | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
gender is ENUM (category) of type 'female', 'male', or 'other'.
Each row in this table contains the ID of a user and their gender.
The table has an equal number of 'female', 'male', and 'other'.
```

Write a solution to rearrange the `Genders` table such that the rows alternate between `'female'`, `'other'`, and `'male'` in order. The table should be rearranged such that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.

Return the result table in **the mentioned order**.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Genders table:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 3       | female |
| 8       | male   |
| 6       | other  |
| 1       | other  |
| 9       | female |
+---------+--------+
Output:
+---------+--------+
| user_id | gender |
+---------+--------+
| 3       | female |
| 1       | other  |
| 4       | male   |
| 7       | female |
| 2       | other  |
| 5       | male   |
| 9       | female |
| 6       | other  |
| 8       | male   |
+---------+--------+
Explanation:
Female gender: IDs 3, 7, and 9.
Other gender: IDs 1, 2, and 6.
Male gender: IDs 4, 5, and 8.
We arrange the table alternating between 'female', 'other', and 'male'.
Note that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to rearrange the Genders table so that rows alternate between 'female', 'other', and 'male' in that specific order. Within each gender, the user_ids should be sorted in ascending order. The key aspects are:

1. The rows must follow the pattern: female, other, male, female, other, male, ...
2. For each gender, the user_ids must be in ascending order
3. The table has an equal number of each gender category

## Step 1: Assign row numbers to each gender

```SQL
SELECT user_id, gender,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
FROM Genders
```

Explanation: We start by assigning a row number to each user within their gender group, sorted by user_id. This gives us a way to pair corresponding rows from different gender groups.

## Step 2: Create a common joining field

```SQL
SELECT user_id, gender,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
FROM Genders
ORDER BY row_num,
         CASE gender
           WHEN 'female' THEN 1
           WHEN 'other' THEN 2
           WHEN 'male' THEN 3
         END
```

Explanation: We assign a priority to each gender ('female' = 1, 'other' = 2, 'male' = 3) and then order by row_num first, then by this gender priority. This almost gives us the pattern we want, but not quite.

## Step 3: Use a better approach with UNION ALL

```SQL
(SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
 FROM Genders
 WHERE gender = 'female')
UNION ALL
(SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
 FROM Genders
 WHERE gender = 'other')
UNION ALL
(SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
 FROM Genders
 WHERE gender = 'male')
ORDER BY row_num,
         CASE gender
           WHEN 'female' THEN 1
           WHEN 'other' THEN 2
           WHEN 'male' THEN 3
         END
```

Explanation: This approach isn't quite right either, as it would group all females first, then all others, then all males.

## Step 4: Join with a row number approach

```SQL
WITH RankedGenders AS (
    SELECT user_id, gender,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
    FROM Genders
)
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM RankedGenders
ORDER BY row_num,
         CASE gender
           WHEN 'female' THEN 1
           WHEN 'other' THEN 2
           WHEN 'male' THEN 3
         END
```

Explanation: This is getting closer, but we need to make sure we interleave the rows correctly.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedGenders AS (
    SELECT user_id, gender,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id) AS row_num
    FROM Genders
)
SELECT user_id, gender
FROM RankedGenders
ORDER BY row_num,
         CASE gender
           WHEN 'female' THEN 1
           WHEN 'other' THEN 2
           WHEN 'male' THEN 3
         END
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) that assigns a row number to each user within their gender group, sorted by user_id
2. Orders the results first by row_num (to group rows with the same position in their respective gender groups)
3. Then orders by gender priority ('female' = 1, 'other' = 2, 'male' = 3) to ensure the correct alternating pattern

Looking at the example data:

- The first row of each gender would be: female user_id 3, other user_id 1, male user_id 4
- The second row of each gender would be: female user_id 7, other user_id 2, male user_id 5
- The third row of each gender would be: female user_id 9, other user_id 6, male user_id 8

When ordered as described, we get the alternating pattern: female, other, male, female, other, male, female, other, male - exactly as required.
