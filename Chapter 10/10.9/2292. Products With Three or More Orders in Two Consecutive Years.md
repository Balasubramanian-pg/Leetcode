**Description**

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| order_id      | int  |
| product_id    | int  |
| quantity      | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
+---------------+------+
order_id contains unique values.
Each row in this table contains the ID of an order, the id of the product purchased, the quantity, and the purchase date.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of all the products that were ordered three or more times in two consecutive years.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is shown in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
| order_id | product_id | quantity | purchase_date |
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 1          | 7        | 2020-03-16    |
| 2        | 1          | 4        | 2020-12-02    |
| 3        | 1          | 7        | 2020-05-10    |
| 4        | 1          | 6        | 2021-12-23    |
| 5        | 1          | 5        | 2021-05-21    |
| 6        | 1          | 6        | 2021-10-11    |
| 7        | 2          | 6        | 2022-10-11    |
+----------+------------+----------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+
| product_id |
+------------+
| 1          |
+------------+
Explanation:
Product 1 was ordered in 2020 three times and in 2021 three times. Since it was ordered three times in two consecutive years, we include it in the answer.
Product 2 was ordered one time in 2022. We do not include it in the answer.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find products that were ordered at least 3 times in each of two consecutive years. We need to:

1. Count how many times each product was ordered in each year
2. Find products that have at least 3 orders in a year
3. Check if any product has at least 3 orders in two consecutive years

## Step 1: Count orders by product and year

```SQL
SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
```

Explanation: We start by counting how many times each product was ordered in each year. We extract the year from purchase_date and group by both product_id and year.

## Step 2: Filter for products with at least 3 orders in a year

```SQL
SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
FROM Orders
GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
```

Explanation: We modify our query to include only products that were ordered at least 3 times in a given year.

## Step 3: Find consecutive years with at least 3 orders

```SQL
SELECT a.product_id
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) a
JOIN (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) b ON a.product_id = b.product_id AND a.year = b.year - 1
```

Explanation: We use a self-join to find products that appear in the filtered results for two consecutive years. We join on product_id and where one year is one less than the other.

## Step 4: Return distinct product IDs

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT a.product_id
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) a
JOIN (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) b ON a.product_id = b.product_id AND a.year = b.year - 1
```

Explanation: We add DISTINCT to ensure each product is listed only once in our final result, even if it was ordered 3+ times in more than two consecutive years.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT a.product_id
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) a
JOIN (
    SELECT product_id, YEAR(purchase_date) AS year
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY product_id, YEAR(purchase_date)
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
) b ON a.product_id = b.product_id AND a.year + 1 = b.year
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Creates two subqueries that find products with at least 3 orders in a given year
2. Joins these subqueries on product_id where the years are consecutive (a.year + 1 = b.year)
3. Uses DISTINCT to ensure each qualifying product appears only once in the result

Looking at the example data:

- Product 1 was ordered 3 times in 2020 and 3 times in 2021, which are consecutive years
- So product 1 is included in the result
- Product 2 was only ordered once in 2022, so it doesn't qualify

Note: I fixed the join condition in the final solution to be `a.year + 1 = b.year` to correctly identify consecutive years.
