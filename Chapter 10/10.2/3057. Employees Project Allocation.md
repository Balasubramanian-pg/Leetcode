**Description**

Table: `Project`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
| workload    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) toEmployee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id and the workload of the project.
```

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| team             | varchar |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
```

Write a solution to find the **employees** who are allocated to projects with a **workload that exceeds the average** workload of all employees for **their respective teams**

Return t_he result table ordered by_ `employee_id`, `project_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| project_id  | employee_id | workload |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
| 1           | 1           |  45      |
| 1           | 2           |  90      |
| 2           | 3           |  12      |
| 2           | 4           |  68      |
+-------------+-------------+----------+
Employees table:
+-------------+--------+------+
| employee_id | name   | team |
+-------------+--------+------+
| 1           | Khaled | A    |
| 2           | Ali    | B    |
| 3           | John   | B    |
| 4           | Doe    | A    |
+-------------+--------+------+
Output:
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
| employee_id | project_id | employee_name | project_workload |
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
| 2           | 1          | Ali           | 90               |
| 4           | 2          | Doe           | 68               |
+-------------+------------+---------------+------------------+
Explanation:
- Employee with ID 1 has a project workload of 45 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 2 has a project workload of 90 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
- Employee with ID 3 has a project workload of 12 and belongs to Team B, where the average workload is 51.00. Since his project workload does not exceed the team's average workload, he will be excluded.
- Employee with ID 4 has a project workload of 68 and belongs to Team A, where the average workload is 56.50. Since his project workload does exceed the team's average workload, he will be included.
Result table orderd by employee_id, project_id in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

To solve this problem, we will proceed step-by-step using **procedural decomposition**, ensuring clarity and correctness in the query design.

---

### **Step 1: Join Employees and Project Tables**

We need to combine employee information with their workload and team.

```SQL
SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    e.team,
    p.project_id,
    p.workload
FROM
    Employees e
JOIN
    Project p ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
```

---

### **Step 2: Compute Team-wise Average Workload**

We compute the average workload per team. This needs to be done at the granularity of **each employee** (i.e., all project workloads summed up per employee, then averaged per team).

```SQL
WITH EmployeeWorkload AS (
    SELECT
        e.team,
        e.employee_id,
        SUM(p.workload) AS total_workload
    FROM
        Employees e
    JOIN
        Project p ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
    GROUP BY
        e.team, e.employee_id
),
TeamAvgWorkload AS (
    SELECT
        team,
        AVG(total_workload) AS avg_workload
    FROM
        EmployeeWorkload
    GROUP BY
        team
)
```

---

### **Step 3: Compare Each Employee's Project Workload with Their Team's Average**

Now, we use the full join from step 1 and compare project-level workloads against team-level average workload (from Step 2).

```SQL
SELECT
    p.employee_id,
    p.project_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    p.workload AS project_workload
FROM
    Project p
JOIN
    Employees e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN
    TeamAvgWorkload t ON e.team = t.team
WHERE
    p.workload > t.avg_workload
ORDER BY
    p.employee_id, p.project_id
```

---

### **Final Combined Query**

```SQL
WITH EmployeeWorkload AS (
    SELECT
        e.team,
        e.employee_id,
        SUM(p.workload) AS total_workload
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Project p ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
    GROUP BY
        e.team, e.employee_id
),
TeamAvgWorkload AS (
    SELECT
        team,
        AVG(total_workload) AS avg_workload
    FROM EmployeeWorkload
    GROUP BY team
)
SELECT
    p.employee_id,
    p.project_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    p.workload AS project_workload
FROM Project p
JOIN Employees e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN TeamAvgWorkload t ON e.team = t.team
WHERE p.workload > t.avg_workload
ORDER BY p.employee_id, p.project_id;
```

---

This approach ensures:

- Team average is based on total workload per employee.
- Each individual project is assessed against this average.
- Only those project allocations that exceed this benchmark are returned.

Would you like a variant where we compare total workload per employee instead of per project?
