**Description**

Table `Salaries`:

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| company_id    | int     |
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| salary        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(company_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the company id, the id, the name, and the salary for an employee.
```

Find the salaries of the employees after applying taxes. Round the salary to **the nearest integer**.

The tax rate is calculated for each company based on the following criteria:

- `0%` If the max salary of any employee in the company is less than `$1000`.
- `24%` If the max salary of any employee in the company is in the range `[1000, 10000]` inclusive.
- `49%` If the max salary of any employee in the company is greater than `$10000`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Salaries table:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 2000   |
| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 21300  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 10800  |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 100    |
| 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 2200   |
| 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 3300   |
| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 7777   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
Output:
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| company_id | employee_id | employee_name | salary |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
| 1          | 1           | Tony          | 1020   |
| 1          | 2           | Pronub        | 10863  |
| 1          | 3           | Tyrrox        | 5508   |
| 2          | 1           | Pam           | 300    |
| 2          | 7           | Bassem        | 450    |
| 2          | 9           | Hermione      | 700    |
| 3          | 7           | Bocaben       | 76     |
| 3          | 2           | Ognjen        | 1672   |
| 3          | 13          | Nyancat       | 2508   |
| 3          | 15          | Morninngcat   | 5911   |
+------------+-------------+---------------+--------+
Explanation:
For company 1, Max salary is 21300. Employees in company 1 have taxes = 49%
For company 2, Max salary is 700. Employees in company 2 have taxes = 0%
For company 3, Max salary is 7777. Employees in company 3 have taxes = 24%
The salary after taxes = salary - (taxes percentage / 100) * salary
For example, Salary for Morninngcat (3, 15) after taxes = 7777 - 7777 * (24 / 100) = 7777 - 1866.48 = 5910.52, which is rounded to 5911.

## Solutions

I'll write a solution to calculate salaries after applying taxes based on the maximum salary in each company.

For this problem, we need to:

1. Determine the maximum salary for each company
2. Apply the appropriate tax rate based on that maximum salary
3. Calculate the after-tax salary and round to the nearest integer
4. Return all employee information with the updated salaries

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
WITH CompanyMaxSalary AS (
    SELECT
        company_id,
        MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM
        Salaries
    GROUP BY
        company_id
),
TaxRates AS (
    SELECT
        company_id,
        CASE
            WHEN max_salary < 1000 THEN 0
            WHEN max_salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 10000 THEN 24
            ELSE 49
        END AS tax_rate
    FROM
        CompanyMaxSalary
)
SELECT
    s.company_id,
    s.employee_id,
    s.employee_name,
    ROUND(s.salary * (1 - t.tax_rate/100)) AS salary
FROM
    Salaries s
JOIN
    TaxRates t ON s.company_id = t.company_id
```

This solution:

1. First creates a CTE called CompanyMaxSalary to find the maximum salary for each company
2. Creates a second CTE called TaxRates to determine the tax rate for each company based on their maximum salary:
    - 0% if max salary < $1000
    - 24% if max salary is between $1000 and $10000 (inclusive)
    - 49% if max salary > $10000
3. Joins the Salaries table with the TaxRates CTE
4. Calculates the after-tax salary using the formula: salary * (1 - tax_rate/100)
5. Rounds the result to the nearest integer using the ROUND function

Following the example data:

- Company 1 has a max salary of $21,300, so tax rate is 49%
- Company 2 has a max salary of $700, so tax rate is 0%
- Company 3 has a max salary of $7,777, so tax rate is 24%

The calculated salaries would be:

- Tony: $2,000 * (1 - 0.49) = $1,020
- Pronub: $21,300 * (1 - 0.49) = $10,863
- And so on...

This matches the expected output.
