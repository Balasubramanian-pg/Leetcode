**Description**

Table: `Project`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key (reference column) toEmployee table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.
```

Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table contains information about one employee.
```

Write a solution to report the **most experienced** employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+

# SQL Problem: Finding the Most Experienced Employees in Each Project

Let me solve this problem step by step while explaining my thought process.

## Procedural Decomposition

### 1. Understanding the Problem

**Procedural step:** Identify the requirements and expected output.

**My thought process:**  
This problem asks us to identify the most experienced employees in each project. Specifically:  

- For each project, we need to find employees with the maximum experience years
- If multiple employees tie for maximum experience in a project, we should include all of them
- We need to return project_id and employee_id columns

Looking at the example data, I can see for project_id 1, both employees 1 and 3 have 3 years of experience (the maximum), so both are included. For project_id 2, employee 1 has the most experience (3 years), so only that employee is included.

### 2. Analyzing the Data Structure

**Procedural step:** Understand how the tables relate to each other.

**My thought process:**  
We have two tables:  

- Project: Maps employees to projects (contains project_id and employee_id)
- Employee: Contains employee details including experience_years

We need to join these tables to associate experience_years with each project-employee combination. Then we need to find the maximum experience_years for each project and select only the employees with that maximum.

### 3. Planning the Overall Strategy

**Procedural step:** Determine the approach to solve the problem.

**My thought process:**  
I can think of several approaches:  

1. **Window Function Approach**: Use RANK() or ROW_NUMBER() to rank employees within each project by experience_years
2. **JOIN with Subquery**: Join the tables and use a subquery to find the maximum experience_years for each project
3. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: Use a CTE to first join the tables, then find the maximum experience by project

The window function approach seems most elegant, as it directly ranks employees by experience within each project group.

### 4. Implementing the Solution Using Window Functions

**Procedural step:** Write the query using window functions.

```SQL
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        p.employee_id,
        e.experience_years,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.project_id ORDER BY e.experience_years DESC) AS experience_rank
    FROM
        Project p
        JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    employee_id
FROM
    RankedEmployees
WHERE
    experience_rank = 1;
```

**My thought process:**  
This solution:  

1. Joins the Project and Employee tables to get experience_years for each project-employee combination
2. Uses RANK() to rank employees within each project based on experience_years in descending order
3. Filters out only the employees with rank 1 (those with the maximum experience in their project)

I chose RANK() over ROW_NUMBER() because RANK() assigns the same rank to ties, which is what we need for this problem. If multiple employees have the same maximum experience in a project, they should all get rank 1.

### 5. Alternative Approach: Using a Subquery

**Procedural step:** Consider an alternative solution using a subquery.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    p.employee_id
FROM
    Project p
    JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE
    e.experience_years = (
        SELECT MAX(e2.experience_years)
        FROM Project p2
        JOIN Employee e2 ON p2.employee_id = e2.employee_id
        WHERE p2.project_id = p.project_id
    );
```

**My thought process:**  
This alternative solution:  

1. Joins the Project and Employee tables
2. For each project-employee combination, uses a correlated subquery to find the maximum experience_years within that project
3. Keeps only project-employee combinations where the employee's experience_years equals that project's maximum

This approach works, but it's less efficient than the window function approach because the subquery runs for each row in the result set.

### 6. Alternative Approach: Using JOIN with GROUP BY

**Procedural step:** Consider another alternative using JOIN with GROUP BY.

```SQL
WITH ProjectMaxExperience AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        MAX(e.experience_years) AS max_experience
    FROM
        Project p
        JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
    GROUP BY
        p.project_id
)
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    p.employee_id
FROM
    Project p
    JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
    JOIN ProjectMaxExperience pme ON p.project_id = pme.project_id
WHERE
    e.experience_years = pme.max_experience;
```

**My thought process:**  
This approach:  

1. First calculates the maximum experience_years for each project using GROUP BY
2. Then joins this result back with the original tables to find employees with that maximum experience

This is more efficient than the correlated subquery approach, but still not as elegant as the window function solution.

### 7. Simplifying the Window Function Solution

**Procedural step:** Refine the window function approach for clarity.

```SQL
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        p.employee_id,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.project_id ORDER BY e.experience_years DESC) AS experience_rank
    FROM
        Project p
        JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    employee_id
FROM
    RankedEmployees
WHERE
    experience_rank = 1;
```

**My thought process:**  
I realized we don't need to include experience_years in the output, so I removed it from the SELECT clause in the CTE. This makes the query cleaner while maintaining the same functionality.  

### 8. Further Simplification Using USING Clause

**Procedural step:** Consider MySQL-specific simplifications.

```SQL
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        employee_id,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY project_id ORDER BY experience_years DESC) AS experience_rank
    FROM
        Project
        JOIN Employee USING (employee_id)
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    employee_id
FROM
    RankedEmployees
WHERE
    experience_rank = 1;
```

**My thought process:**  
Since both tables have a column named employee_id, I can use the USING clause in MySQL to simplify the JOIN. This makes the query more concise while maintaining the same logic.  

### 9. Testing with the Example Data

**Procedural step:** Validate the solution against the provided example.

**My thought process:**  
Let's trace through the execution:  

1. Join Project and Employee:
    - (1, 1, "Khaled", 3)
    - (1, 2, "Ali", 2)
    - (1, 3, "John", 3)
    - (2, 1, "Khaled", 3)
    - (2, 4, "Doe", 2)
2. Rank by experience_years within each project:
    - (1, 1, 3, rank=1)
    - (1, 2, 2, rank=3)
    - (1, 3, 3, rank=1)
    - (2, 1, 3, rank=1)
    - (2, 4, 2, rank=2)
3. Filter by rank=1:
    - (1, 1)
    - (1, 3)
    - (2, 1)

This matches the expected output.

## Final Solution

After considering all approaches and optimizations, the most elegant solution is:

```SQL
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        employee_id,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY project_id ORDER BY experience_years DESC) AS experience_rank
    FROM
        Project
        JOIN Employee USING (employee_id)
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    employee_id
FROM
    RankedEmployees
WHERE
    experience_rank = 1;
```

This solution:

1. Efficiently joins the tables to access experience_years for each project-employee combination
2. Uses RANK() to identify employees with the maximum experience within each project
3. Properly handles ties by giving the same rank to employees with equal experience
4. Returns exactly the columns required (project_id and employee_id)
5. Is clear, concise, and optimized for performance

The window function approach is particularly well-suited for this type of "find the top N in each group" problem, making it the ideal choice for identifying the most experienced employees in each project.

  

In the CTE solution for finding the most experienced employees, we directly reference columns like `project_id` and `name` without table aliases because of how SQL's scoping rules work in CTEs. Here's why this works:

### Why Unqualified Column Names Work in CTEs:

1. **Column Uniqueness in the CTE**:
    
    ```SQL
    WITH RankedEmployees AS (
        SELECT
            p.project_id,
            p.employee_id,
            e.name,
            e.experience_years,
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (...) AS experience_rank
        FROM ...
    )
    ```
    
    - The CTE's SELECT creates a new result set with these specific columns
    - Within the CTE's body, we need aliases (`p.`, `e.`) because we're joining tables
    - But in the outer query, we're selecting from just the CTE
2. **Outer Query Context**:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        project_id,  -- From RankedEmployees
        employee_id, -- From RankedEmployees
        name,       -- From RankedEmployees
        experience_years
    FROM
        RankedEmployees
    ```
    
    - The outer query only sees the columns defined in the CTE
    - There's no ambiguity since we're not joining additional tables
3. **Best Practice**:
    - While this works, some developers prefer to keep the aliases for clarity:
        
        ```SQL
        SELECT
            re.project_id,
            re.employee_id,
            re.name,
            re.experience_years
        FROM
            RankedEmployees re
        ```
        
    - This makes it explicit where columns come from, especially in complex queries

### When You MUST Use Aliases:

1. If the CTE had columns with the same name from different tables:
    
    ```SQL
    WITH CTE AS (
        SELECT p.id AS project_id, e.id AS employee_id ...
    )
    ```
    
    - Then you'd need to use the aliased names
2. When joining the CTE with other tables in the outer query

### Key Takeaway:

The unqualified names work here because:

1. The CTE produces a clean result set with uniquely named columns
2. The outer query only references this single result set
3. There are no naming conflicts in this particular query

Both styles (with or without CTE column qualifiers) are valid, but being explicit with aliases often makes queries more maintainable.

  

# Handling Ties in Most Experienced Employees Query

To get rid of ties and return only one employee per project (even when multiple employees share the maximum experience years), you have several options:

## Option 1: Use ROW_NUMBER() instead of DENSE_RANK()

```SQL
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        p.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.experience_years,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY p.project_id
            ORDER BY e.experience_years DESC,
                     p.employee_id  -- or e.name for alphabetical tiebreaker
        ) AS rank
    FROM
        Project p
    JOIN
        Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT
    project_id,
    employee_id,
    name,
    experience_years
FROM
    RankedEmployees
WHERE
    rank = 1;
```

**Key Difference**:

- `ROW_NUMBER()` always assigns unique ranks (no ties)
- Added `employee_id` (or `name`) as a tiebreaker in the `ORDER BY`

## Option 2: Use LIMIT with a Subquery

```SQL
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    e.employee_id,
    e.name,
    e.experience_years
FROM
    Project p
JOIN
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN (
    SELECT
        project_id,
        MAX(experience_years) AS max_exp
    FROM
        Project p
    JOIN
        Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
    GROUP BY
        project_id
) max_exp ON p.project_id = max_exp.project_id
         AND e.experience_years = max_exp.max_exp
ORDER BY
    p.project_id,
    e.employee_id  -- or e.name
LIMIT 1 PER project_id;  -- MySQL syntax
```

**Note**: The `LIMIT 1 PER project_id` syntax works in MySQL. For other databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: Use `DISTINCT ON`:
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (p.project_id)
        p.project_id,
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.experience_years
    FROM ...
    ORDER BY p.project_id, e.experience_years DESC, e.employee_id;
    ```
    
- **SQL Server**: Use `TOP 1 WITH TIES` or a CTE with ROW_NUMBER()

## Option 3: Arbitrary Selection with GROUP BY

```SQL
SELECT
    p.project_id,
    MIN(e.employee_id) AS employee_id,
    MIN(e.name) AS name,
    MAX(e.experience_years) AS experience_years
FROM
    Project p
JOIN
    Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE
    (p.project_id, e.experience_years) IN (
        SELECT
            p.project_id,
            MAX(e.experience_years)
        FROM
            Project p
        JOIN
            Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
        GROUP BY
            p.project_id
    )
GROUP BY
    p.project_id;
```

**Note**: This arbitrarily selects the employee with the smallest ID when there are ties.

## Recommendation

The `ROW_NUMBER()` approach (Option 1) is generally the clearest and most flexible solution, as it:

1. Explicitly shows how ties are broken
2. Works across all major SQL databases
3. Allows you to customize the tiebreaker logic (by employee_id, name, etc.)
