**Description**

Table: `Employees`

```Plain
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| employee_id  | int  |
| needed_hours | int  |
+--------------+------+
employee_id is column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains the id of an employee and the minimum number of hours needed for them to work to get their salary.
```

Table: `Logs`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| employee_id | int      |
| in_time     | datetime |
| out_time    | datetime |
+-------------+----------+
(employee_id, in_time, out_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table shows the time stamps for an employee. in_time is the time the employee started to work, and out_time is the time the employee ended work.
All the times are in October 2022. out_time can be one day after in_time which means the employee worked after the midnight.
```

In a company, each employee must work a certain number of  
hours every month. Employees work in sessions. The number of hours an  
employee worked can be calculated from the sum of the number of minutes  
the employee worked in all of their sessions. The number of minutes in  
each session is rounded up.  

- For example, if the employee worked for `51` minutes and `2` seconds in a session, we consider it `52` minutes.

Write a solution to report the IDs of the employees that  
will be deducted. In other words, report the IDs of the employees that  
did not work the needed hours.  

Return the result table **in any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+--------------+
| employee_id | needed_hours |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | 20           |
| 2           | 12           |
| 3           | 2            |
+-------------+--------------+
Logs table:
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| employee_id | in_time             | out_time            |
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1           | 2022-10-01 09:00:00 | 2022-10-01 17:00:00 |
| 1           | 2022-10-06 09:05:04 | 2022-10-06 17:09:03 |
| 1           | 2022-10-12 23:00:00 | 2022-10-13 03:00:01 |
| 2           | 2022-10-29 12:00:00 | 2022-10-29 23:58:58 |
+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation:
Employee 1:
 - Worked for three sessions:
    - On 2022-10-01, they worked for 8 hours.
    - On 2022-10-06, they worked for 8 hours and 4 minutes.
    - On 2022-10-12, they worked for 4 hours and 1 minute. Note that they worked through midnight.
 - Employee 1 worked a total of 20 hours and 5 minutes across sessions and will not be deducted.
Employee 2:
 - Worked for one session:
    - On 2022-10-29, they worked for 11 hours and 59 minutes.
 - Employee 2 did not work their hours and will be deducted.
Employee 3:
 - Did not work any session.
 - Employee 3 did not work their hours and will be deducted.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to identify employees who did not work their required hours in October 2022
-- For each employee, we need to calculate total working time across all sessions
-- Session time is calculated in minutes and rounded up (ceiling function)
-- Then convert minutes to hours and compare with needed_hours
-- Return employee_ids of those who did not meet their needed hours
```

Explanation: This problem requires us to calculate the total working time for each employee across all their sessions, and then compare it with their required working hours. We need to identify employees who worked less than their required hours.

Step 2: Calculate Working Time for Each Session

```SQL
SELECT
    employee_id,
    CEILING(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, in_time, out_time)) as minutes_worked
FROM Logs
```

Explanation: First, we calculate the duration of each session in minutes using TIMESTAMPDIFF, which gives us the difference between out_time and in_time. We use the CEILING function to round up the minutes as required by the problem statement.

Step 3: Calculate Total Working Time for Each Employee

```SQL
SELECT
    employee_id,
    SUM(CEILING(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, in_time, out_time))) as total_minutes
FROM Logs
GROUP BY employee_id
```

Explanation: Now we aggregate the minutes worked for each employee by summing up the duration of all their sessions. This gives us the total working time in minutes for each employee who has at least one session logged.

Step 4: Convert Minutes to Hours and Compare with Needed Hours

```SQL
WITH WorkingTime AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        SUM(CEILING(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, in_time, out_time))) / 60 as total_hours
    FROM Logs
    GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT
    e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN WorkingTime w ON e.employee_id = w.employee_id
WHERE w.total_hours IS NULL OR w.total_hours < e.needed_hours
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to hold the total working time for each employee in hours. Then we join this with the Employees table to compare the actual hours worked with the needed hours. The LEFT JOIN ensures that employees who have no sessions in the Logs table (like Employee 3 in the example) are also included in the result. We use the condition `w.total_hours IS NULL OR w.total_hours < e.needed_hours` to identify employees who either have no logs or whose total working hours are less than what they need.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH WorkingTime AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        SUM(CEILING(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, in_time, out_time))) / 60 as total_hours
    FROM Logs
    GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT
    e.employee_id
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN WorkingTime w ON e.employee_id = w.employee_id
WHERE w.total_hours IS NULL OR w.total_hours < e.needed_hours
```

Explanation: The final solution:

1. Calculates the working time for each session, rounded up to the nearest minute
2. Aggregates the total working time for each employee and converts it to hours
3. Compares the actual working hours with the needed hours for each employee
4. Returns the employee_ids of those who did not meet their needed hours

This SQL query correctly identifies employees who did not work their required hours, considering both those who worked less than required and those who did not work at all.
