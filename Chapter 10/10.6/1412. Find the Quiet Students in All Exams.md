**Description**

Table: `Student`

```Plain
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| student_id          | int     |
| student_name        | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
student_name is the name of the student.
```

Table: `Exam`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| exam_id       | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| score         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the student with student_id had a score points in the exam with id exam_id.
```

A **quiet student** is the one who took at least one exam and did not score the highest or the lowest score.

Write a solutionÂ to report the students `(student_id, student_name)` being quiet in all exams. Do not return the student who has never taken any exam.

Return the result table **ordered** by `student_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Jade          |
| 3           | Stella        |
| 4           | Jonathan      |
| 5           | Will          |
+-------------+---------------+
Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |
| 30         |     1        |    70     |
| 30         |     3        |    80     |
| 30         |     4        |    90     |
| 40         |     1        |    60     |
| 40         |     2        |    70     |
| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 2           | Jade          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation:
For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exams.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
```

I'll write a solution to find the "quiet students" who never scored the highest or lowest in any exam they took.

Let me break down this problem:

1. A quiet student is one who took at least one exam
2. This student never scored the highest in any exam
3. This student never scored the lowest in any exam
4. We need to order the results by student_id

Here's my SQL solution:

```SQL
WITH ExamRanks AS (
    SELECT
        e.exam_id,
        e.student_id,
        e.score,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY e.exam_id ORDER BY e.score) AS lowest_rank,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY e.exam_id ORDER BY e.score DESC) AS highest_rank
    FROM Exam e
)

SELECT
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name
FROM
    Student s
WHERE
    s.student_id IN (
        -- Students who took at least one exam
        SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM Exam
    )
    AND s.student_id NOT IN (
        -- Students who scored highest in any exam
        SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM ExamRanks WHERE highest_rank = 1
    )
    AND s.student_id NOT IN (
        -- Students who scored lowest in any exam
        SELECT DISTINCT student_id FROM ExamRanks WHERE lowest_rank = 1
    )
ORDER BY
    s.student_id;
```

This solution:

1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `ExamRanks` that calculates:
    - For each exam, each student's position from highest score (highest_rank)
    - For each exam, each student's position from lowest score (lowest_rank)
2. Selects students who:
    - Took at least one exam (IN clause with Exam table)
    - Never had the highest score (NOT IN clause with highest_rank = 1)
    - Never had the lowest score (NOT IN clause with lowest_rank = 1)
3. Orders the results by student_id

Looking at the example data, only student_id 2 (Jade) meets all criteria, which matches the expected output.

Alternative solution using GROUP BY and HAVING:

```SQL
WITH ExamStats AS (
    SELECT
        e.exam_id,
        MIN(e.score) AS min_score,
        MAX(e.score) AS max_score
    FROM
        Exam e
    GROUP BY
        e.exam_id
)

SELECT
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name
FROM
    Student s
JOIN
    Exam e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN
    ExamStats es ON e.exam_id = es.exam_id
                  AND (e.score = es.min_score OR e.score = es.max_score)
GROUP BY
    s.student_id,
    s.student_name
HAVING
    COUNT(e.exam_id) > 0 AND      -- Took at least one exam
    COUNT(es.exam_id) = 0         -- Never had highest or lowest score
ORDER BY
    s.student_id;
```

This approach:

1. Creates a CTE to find min and max scores for each exam
2. Joins Student, Exam, and ExamStats tables
3. Uses LEFT JOIN with the condition that matches highest or lowest scores
4. Uses HAVING to ensure the student took exams but never had highest/lowest score

Both solutions produce the correct result of just Jade with student_id 2.
