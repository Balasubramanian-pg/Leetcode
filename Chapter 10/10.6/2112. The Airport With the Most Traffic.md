**Description**

Table: `Flights`

```Plain
+-------------------+------+
| Column Name       | Type |
+-------------------+------+
| departure_airport | int  |
| arrival_airport   | int  |
| flights_count     | int  |
+-------------------+------+
(departure_airport, arrival_airport) is the primary key column (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that there were flights_count flights that departed from departure_airport and arrived at arrival_airport.
```

Write a solution to report the ID of the airport with the **most traffic**.  
The airport with the most traffic is the airport that has the largest  
total number of flights that either departed from or arrived at the  
airport. If there is more than one airport with the most traffic, report  
them all.  

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Flights table:
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| departure_airport | arrival_airport | flights_count |
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| 1                 | 2               | 4             |
| 2                 | 1               | 5             |
| 2                 | 4               | 5             |
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+
| airport_id |
+------------+
| 2          |
+------------+
Explanation:
Airport 1 was engaged with 9 flights (4 departures, 5 arrivals).
Airport 2 was engaged with 14 flights (10 departures, 4 arrivals).
Airport 4 was engaged with 5 flights (5 arrivals).
The airport with the most traffic is airport 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```Plain
Input:
Flights table:
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| departure_airport | arrival_airport | flights_count |
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| 1                 | 2               | 4             |
| 2                 | 1               | 5             |
| 3                 | 4               | 5             |
| 4                 | 3               | 4             |
| 5                 | 6               | 7             |
+-------------------+-----------------+---------------+
Output:
+------------+
| airport_id |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 4          |
+------------+
Explanation:
Airport 1 was engaged with 9 flights (4 departures, 5 arrivals).
Airport 2 was engaged with 9 flights (5 departures, 4 arrivals).
Airport 3 was engaged with 9 flights (5 departures, 4 arrivals).
Airport 4 was engaged with 9 flights (4 departures, 5 arrivals).
Airport 5 was engaged with 7 flights (7 departures).
Airport 6 was engaged with 7 flights (7 arrivals).
The airports with the most traffic are airports 1, 2, 3, and 4.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part along the way.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Count the total number of flights that each airport was involved in
2. This includes both departures from and arrivals to that airport
3. Find the airport(s) with the maximum count
4. Return the airport ID(s)

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Count departures for each airport

```SQL
SELECT departure_airport, SUM(flights_count) AS departures
FROM Flights
GROUP BY departure_airport;
```

Explanation: This query counts how many flights departed from each airport. We use SUM to add up the flights_count for each departure_airport.

## Step 2: Count arrivals for each airport

```SQL
SELECT arrival_airport, SUM(flights_count) AS arrivals
FROM Flights
GROUP BY arrival_airport;
```

Explanation: Similarly, this query counts how many flights arrived at each airport by summing the flights_count for each arrival_airport.

## Step 3: Combine departures and arrivals to get total traffic

```SQL
SELECT airport_id, SUM(flights) AS total_flights
FROM (
    SELECT departure_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
    FROM Flights
    UNION ALL
    SELECT arrival_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
    FROM Flights
) AS combined
GROUP BY airport_id;
```

Explanation: We use UNION ALL to combine departures and arrivals into a single dataset. Then we group by airport_id and sum the flights to get the total traffic for each airport.

## Step 4: Find the maximum traffic

```SQL
SELECT MAX(total_flights) AS max_traffic
FROM (
    SELECT airport_id, SUM(flights) AS total_flights
    FROM (
        SELECT departure_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
        UNION ALL
        SELECT arrival_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
    ) AS combined
    GROUP BY airport_id
) AS traffic;
```

Explanation: This builds on the previous query by finding the maximum total_flights value, which represents the busiest airport(s).

## Step 5: Get the airports with traffic equal to the maximum

```SQL
WITH traffic AS (
    SELECT airport_id, SUM(flights) AS total_flights
    FROM (
        SELECT departure_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
        UNION ALL
        SELECT arrival_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
    ) AS combined
    GROUP BY airport_id
)
SELECT airport_id
FROM traffic
WHERE total_flights = (SELECT MAX(total_flights) FROM traffic);
```

Explanation: Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) for clarity, we first calculate the total traffic for each airport. Then we filter to only include airports whose traffic equals the maximum traffic value.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH traffic AS (
    SELECT airport_id, SUM(flights) AS total_flights
    FROM (
        SELECT departure_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
        UNION ALL
        SELECT arrival_airport AS airport_id, flights_count AS flights
        FROM Flights
    ) AS combined
    GROUP BY airport_id
)
SELECT airport_id
FROM traffic
WHERE total_flights = (SELECT MAX(total_flights) FROM traffic);
```

This query:

1. Uses UNION ALL to combine departure and arrival counts for each airport
2. Calculates the total traffic for each airport
3. Identifies the maximum traffic value
4. Returns all airports that have traffic equal to that maximum value

The use of a CTE makes the query more readable by clearly separating the traffic calculation from the maximum value comparison.
