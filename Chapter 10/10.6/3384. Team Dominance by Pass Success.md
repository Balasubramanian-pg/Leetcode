**Description**

Table: `Teams`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| player_id   | int     |
| team_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
player_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains the unique identifier for player and the name of one of the teams participating in that match.

```

Table: `Passes`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| pass_from   | int     |
| time_stamp  | varchar |
| pass_to     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(pass_from, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
pass_from is a foreign key to player_id from Teams table.
Each row represents a pass made during a match, time_stamp represents the time in minutes (00:00-90:00) when the pass was made,
pass_to is the player_id of the player receiving the pass.

```

Write a solution to calculate the **dominance score** for each team in **both halves of the match**. The rules are as follows:

- A match is divided into two halves: **first half** (`00:0045:00` minutes) and **second half** (`45:0190:00` minutes)
- The dominance score is calculated based on successful and intercepted passes:
    - When pass_to is a player from the **same team**: +`1` point
    - When pass_to is a player from the **opposing team** (interception): `1` point
- A higher dominance score indicates better passing performance

Return _the result table ordered by_ `team_name` and `half_number` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Teams table:

```Plain
+------------+-----------+
| player_id  | team_name |
+------------+-----------+
| 1          | Arsenal   |
| 2          | Arsenal   |
| 3          | Arsenal   |
| 4          | Chelsea   |
| 5          | Chelsea   |
| 6          | Chelsea   |
+------------+-----------+
```

Passes table:

```Plain
+-----------+------------+---------+
| pass_from | time_stamp | pass_to |
+-----------+------------+---------+
| 1         | 00:15      | 2       |
| 2         | 00:45      | 3       |
| 3         | 01:15      | 1       |
| 4         | 00:30      | 1       |
| 2         | 46:00      | 3       |
| 3         | 46:15      | 4       |
| 1         | 46:45      | 2       |
| 5         | 46:30      | 6       |
+-----------+------------+---------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------+-------------+-----------+
| team_name | half_number | dominance |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+
| Arsenal   | 1           | 3         |
| Arsenal   | 2           | 1         |
| Chelsea   | 1           | -1        |
| Chelsea   | 2           | 1         |
+-----------+-------------+-----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Half (00:00-45:00):**
    
    ```Plain
    <ul>
    	<li>Arsenal&#39;s passes:

## Solutions

<Inner Monologue>  
Let's break down this problem step by step:  

1. We have two tables:
    - `Teams`: Contains player IDs and their team names.
    - `Passes`: Contains pass information, including who made the pass (`pass_from`), when (`time_stamp`), and to whom (`pass_to`).
2. We need to calculate a "dominance score" for each team in both halves of a match based on passes:
    - First half: 00:00-45:00 minutes
    - Second half: 45:01-90:00 minutes
3. Dominance score calculation:
    - If a pass goes to a player from the same team: +1 point
    - If a pass goes to a player from the opposing team (interception): -1 point
4. We need to return the dominance score for each team in each half, ordered by team_name and half_number.

To solve this, I'll need to:

- Determine which half each pass belongs to based on the time_stamp.
- Find which team each player (both pass_from and pass_to) belongs to.
- Calculate the dominance score for each team in each half.

Let's start by joining the `Passes` table with the `Teams` table twice: once for pass_from and once for pass_to, so we can determine the team for both players.

```SQL
SELECT
    p.pass_from,
    p.time_stamp,
    p.pass_to,
    t1.team_name AS from_team,
    t2.team_name AS to_team
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
```

Next, I need to determine which half each pass belongs to. I'll use a CASE statement to check the time_stamp:

```SQL
SELECT
    p.pass_from,
    p.time_stamp,
    p.pass_to,
    t1.team_name AS from_team,
    t2.team_name AS to_team,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END AS half_number
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
```

Now, I need to calculate the dominance score. For each pass, I'll check if it's a successful pass or an interception:

```SQL
SELECT
    p.pass_from,
    p.time_stamp,
    p.pass_to,
    t1.team_name AS from_team,
    t2.team_name AS to_team,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END AS half_number,
    CASE
        WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
        ELSE -1  -- Interception
    END AS points
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
```

Finally, I need to group by team and half, and sum the points:

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END AS half_number,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE -1  -- Interception
        END
    ) AS dominance
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
GROUP BY
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END
ORDER BY
    t1.team_name ASC,
    half_number ASC
```

But wait, I just realized that the dominance score is calculated for the entire team based on passes made and received. The points are awarded to the team making the pass, not to individual players. Let me adjust my approach:

```SQL
SELECT
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END AS half_number,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE -1  -- Interception
        END
    ) AS dominance
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
GROUP BY
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END
ORDER BY
    t1.team_name ASC,
    half_number ASC
```

But there's still one more issue. I'm only calculating points for teams that made passes. What about teams that didn't make any passes in a certain half? For example, if Team A didn't make any passes in the second half, they wouldn't appear in the result for the second half.

To handle this, I can use a CROSS JOIN to generate all possible team and half combinations, and then LEFT JOIN this with the calculated dominance scores:

```SQL
-- Generate all team and half combinations
WITH team_halves AS (
    SELECT
        t.team_name,
        h.half_number
    FROM
        (SELECT DISTINCT team_name FROM Teams) t
    CROSS JOIN
        (SELECT 1 AS half_number UNION SELECT 2) h
),
-- Calculate dominance scores
dominance_scores AS (
    SELECT
        t1.team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
            ELSE 2  -- Second half
        END AS half_number,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
                ELSE -1  -- Interception
            END
        ) AS dominance
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    GROUP BY
        t1.team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
            ELSE 2  -- Second half
        END
)
-- Join team_halves with dominance_scores
SELECT
    th.team_name,
    th.half_number,
    COALESCE(ds.dominance, 0) AS dominance
FROM
    team_halves th
LEFT JOIN
    dominance_scores ds ON th.team_name = ds.team_name AND th.half_number = ds.half_number
ORDER BY
    th.team_name ASC,
    th.half_number ASC
```

Wait, I just realized a flaw in my logic. The problem states:

- When pass_to is a player from the same team: +1 point
- When pass_to is a player from the opposing team (interception): -1 point

This means that the dominance score is calculated for the team of the pass_from player, not the team as a whole. Let me adjust my approach again:

```SQL
-- Calculate dominance scores
SELECT
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END AS half_number,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
            ELSE -1  -- Interception
        END
    ) AS dominance
FROM
    Passes p
JOIN
    Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
JOIN
    Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
GROUP BY
    t1.team_name,
    CASE
        WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
        ELSE 2  -- Second half
    END
ORDER BY
    t1.team_name ASC,
    half_number ASC
```

But wait, I have to consider all teams regardless of whether they made passes or not. Let me use the approach with the CROSS JOIN:

```SQL
-- Generate all team and half combinations
WITH team_halves AS (
    SELECT
        t.team_name,
        h.half_number
    FROM
        (SELECT DISTINCT team_name FROM Teams) t
    CROSS JOIN
        (SELECT 1 AS half_number UNION SELECT 2) h
),
-- Calculate dominance scores
dominance_scores AS (
    SELECT
        t1.team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
            ELSE 2  -- Second half
        END AS half_number,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1  -- Successful pass
                ELSE -1  -- Interception
            END
        ) AS dominance
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    GROUP BY
        t1.team_name,
        CASE
            WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1  -- First half
            ELSE 2  -- Second half
        END
)
-- Join team_halves with dominance_scores
SELECT
    th.team_name,
    th.half_number,
    COALESCE(ds.dominance, 0) AS dominance
FROM
    team_halves th
LEFT JOIN
    dominance_scores ds ON th.team_name = ds.team_name AND th.half_number = ds.half_number
ORDER BY
    th.team_name ASC,
    th.half_number ASC
```

Checking the instructions again, I see that I need to return "dominance" as the score column, and I need to order by team_name and half_number.

Also, reading the example output again, all teams are there for both halves. So I need to ensure that my solution includes all teams for both halves.

Let me trace through the example data to make sure my solution is correct:

Arsenal (First Half):

- 1 -> 2 (00:15): Arsenal to Arsenal, +1
- 2 -> 3 (00:45): Arsenal to Arsenal, +1
- 3 -> 1 (01:15): Arsenal to Arsenal, +1
- 4 -> 1 (00:30): Chelsea to Arsenal, -1 (This is an interception from Chelsea's perspective, not Arsenal's)  
    Total for Arsenal in First Half: +3  
    

Chelsea (First Half):

- 4 -> 1 (00:30): Chelsea to Arsenal, -1  
    Total for Chelsea in First Half: -1  
    

Arsenal (Second Half):

- 2 -> 3 (46:00): Arsenal to Arsenal, +1
- 3 -> 4 (46:15): Arsenal to Chelsea, -1
- 1 -> 2 (46:45): Arsenal to Arsenal, +1  
    Total for Arsenal in Second Half: +1  
    

Chelsea (Second Half):

- 5 -> 6 (46:30): Chelsea to Chelsea, +1  
    Total for Chelsea in Second Half: +1  
    

This matches the expected output, so my solution is correct. But there's one more issue: I need to think about whether to handle teams that didn't make passes in a certain half. If a team doesn't make any passes in a half, they should still appear in the result with a dominance score of 0, as shown in the example where all teams are present for both halves.

But looking back at the constraints, I think I might have confused the issue:

- I need to ensure that all teams are present for both halves, even if they didn't make any passes in that half.
- I need to calculate the dominance score for each team in each half based on the passes they made.

So I'll stick with the CROSS JOIN approach to ensure all teams are present for both halves.

Let me double-check my logic:

- If a player from Team A passes to another player from Team A, Team A gets +1 point.
- If a player from Team A passes to a player from Team B, Team A gets -1 point (and Team B doesn't get any points for this).

Yes, I think my solution is correct. I just need to ensure all combinations of team and half are present in the result.

Actually, let me simplify this solution, making it easier to understand and verify:

```SQL
-- First, calculate dominance scores for passes from each team in each half
WITH dominance_scores AS (
    SELECT
        t1.team_name,
        CASE WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END AS half_number,
        SUM(CASE WHEN t1.team_name = t2.team_name THEN 1 ELSE -1 END) AS dominance
    FROM
        Passes p
    JOIN
        Teams t1 ON p.pass_from = t1.player_id
    JOIN
        Teams t2 ON p.pass_to = t2.player_id
    GROUP BY
        t1.team_name,
        CASE WHEN p.time_stamp <= '45:00' THEN 1 ELSE 2 END
)

-- Generate all team and half combinations
SELECT
    t.team_name,
    h.half_number,
    COALESCE(ds.dominance, 0) AS dominance
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT team_name FROM Teams) t
CROSS JOIN
    (SELECT 1 AS half_number UNION SELECT 2) h
LEFT JOIN
    dominance_scores ds ON t.team_name = ds.team_name AND h.half_number = ds.half_number
ORDER BY
    t.team_name ASC,
    h.half_number ASC
```

This solution:

1. Calculates the dominance score for each team in each half based on passes they made.
2. Generates all combinations of team and half.
3. Joins the dominance scores with the team-half combinations, using COALESCE to handle NULL values (for teams that didn't make any passes in a half).
4. Orders the results as required.

I believe this solution correctly addresses all aspects of the problem.

</SQL Solution>

This solution calculates the dominance score for each team across both halves of a soccer match, following the specified rules for successful passes and interceptions. Let me break down the approach:

1. **Creating a CTE for Dominance Scores**:
   - I join the Passes table with the Teams table twice (once for the passer and once for the receiver)
   - For each pass, I determine:
     * Which half it belongs to (time_stamp ≤ '45:00' = first half, otherwise second half)
     * Whether it's successful (+1 point when both players are on the same team) or an interception (-1 point when pass goes to opposing team)
   - I group by team and half number, summing the points to get each team's dominance score

2. **Ensuring Complete Results**:
   - I use a CROSS JOIN to generate all possible team and half combinations
   - This ensures every team appears in the results for both halves, even if they didn't make any passes in one half
   - The LEFT JOIN with the dominance_scores CTE connects the calculated scores to each team-half pair
   - COALESCE handles cases where a team didn't make any passes in a half (assigning 0 as the default score)

3. **Ordering the Results**:
   - The results are ordered by team_name and half_number in ascending order

Tracing through the example data:
- Arsenal in first half: 3 successful passes (+3) = +3 dominance
- Arsenal in second half: 2 successful passes (+2), 1 interception (-1) = +1 dominance
- Chelsea in first half: 1 interception (-1) = -1 dominance
- Chelsea in second half: 1 successful pass (+1) = +1 dominance

This matches the expected output and correctly implements the scoring rules from the problem description.
