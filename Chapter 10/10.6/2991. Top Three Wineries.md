Explanation
For Australia
 - HarmonyHill Winery accumulates the highest score of 100 points in Australia.
 - GrapesGalore Winery has a total of 85 points, securing the second-highest position in Australia.
 - WhisperingPines Winery has a total of 80 points, ranking as the third-highest.
For Hungary
 - MoonlitCellars is the sole winery, accruing 60 points, automatically making it the highest. There is no second or third winery.
For India
 - SunsetVines is the sole winery, earning 69 points, making it the top winery. There is no second or third winery.
For the USA
 - RoyalVines Wines accumulates a total of 47 + 39 = 86 points, claiming the highest position in the USA.
 - Eagle'sNest has a total of 45 points, securing the second-highest position in the USA.
 - PacificCrest accumulates 9 points, ranking as the third-highest winery in the USA
Output table is ordered by country in ascending order.

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the top three wineries _in each country_ based on their _total_ points. If there's a tie in total points, we break the tie by winery name alphabetically. We need to present the results with one row per country, showing the names (and total points) of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ranked wineries, or special messages if a rank doesn't exist. Finally, the output must be ordered by country.

We'll be working with the `Wineries` table. The key is that a `winery` name might appear multiple times within a `country`, so we need to sum their points first.

Step 1: Calculate the total points for each unique winery within each country. We group the data by `country` and `winery` and sum the `points`.

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        winery,
        SUM(points) AS total_points
    FROM Wineries
    GROUP BY country, winery
)
-- This CTE calculates the combined score for each unique winery in each country.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `WineryTotalPoints`. We group the `Wineries` table by both `country` and `winery`. For each unique combination, `SUM(points)` calculates the total points earned by that winery in that country.

Step 2: Rank the wineries _within each country_ based on their `total_points`. We need a strict rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and ties in points should be broken by `winery` name alphabetically. The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function is suitable for this, as it assigns a unique rank even for ties based on the `ORDER BY` clause.

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedWineries AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        winery,
        total_points,
        -- Rank wineries within each country based on total points (desc) and then winery name (asc)
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_points DESC, winery ASC) as rnk
    FROM WineryTotalPoints
)
-- This CTE ranks each winery within its country. Rank 1 is the highest, 2 the second, etc., handling ties by winery name.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `RankedWineries` from `WineryTotalPoints`. We add a new column `rnk` using `ROW_NUMBER()`.

- `PARTITION BY country`: The ranking starts over for each different country.
- `ORDER BY total_points DESC, winery ASC`: Within each country, rows are ordered first by `total_points` from highest to lowest, and then by `winery` name alphabetically for any ties in points. `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns 1, 2, 3, etc., based on this strict order.

Step 3: Now we need to restructure the data so that each country is one row, with columns for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd ranked wineries. We can achieve this using conditional aggregation (using `CASE` statements inside aggregation functions like `MAX()`) and grouping by `country`. We will also need to format the output string as "WineryName (TotalPoints)".

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedWineries AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    country,
    -- Find the winery info for rank 1
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS top_winery,
    -- Find the winery info for rank 2
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS second_winery_raw, -- Temporary name
    -- Find the winery info for rank 3
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 3 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS third_winery_raw -- Temporary name
FROM RankedWineries
GROUP BY country;
-- This groups the ranked wineries by country and picks out the string for ranks 1, 2, and 3.
-- Ranks 2 and 3 will be NULL if they don't exist for a country.
```

Explanation: We select from the `RankedWineries` CTE and group by `country`.

- `MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END)`: For each country group, the `CASE` statement evaluates. Only the row where `rnk` is 1 will return the formatted string (e.g., "HarmonyHill (100)"); other rows return `NULL`. `MAX()` then picks the single non-NULL string for that country (the rank 1 winery). This is named `top_winery`.
- Similar logic applies for `rnk = 2` and `rnk = 3`, getting the information for the second and third wineries. These are temporarily named `second_winery_raw` and `third_winery_raw`. If a country has fewer than 2 or 3 wineries, `MAX()` will return `NULL` for these. `CONCAT` is used to combine the winery name, a space, an opening parenthesis, the total points, and a closing parenthesis.

Step 4: We need to replace the `NULL` values for `second_winery_raw` and `third_winery_raw` with the specific strings 'No second winery' and 'No third winery' respectively. We use the `COALESCE()` function for this.

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedWineries AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    country,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS top_winery,
    -- Use COALESCE to replace NULL with the specified string for the second winery
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No second winery') AS second_winery,
    -- Use COALESCE to replace NULL with the specified string for the third winery
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 3 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No third winery') AS third_winery
FROM RankedWineries
GROUP BY country;
-- This replaces the NULL values for missing ranks with the required output strings.
```

Explanation: We apply `COALESCE(..., 'No second winery')` to the expression that gets the rank 2 winery info and `COALESCE(..., 'No third winery')` to the expression for rank 3. `COALESCE` returns the first non-NULL argument. So, if the `MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = X THEN ... END)` result is `NULL`, it returns the specified string instead. The columns are named `second_winery` and `third_winery` as required.

Step 5: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `country` in ascending order.

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
RankedWineries AS ( ... ) -- from step 2
SELECT
    country,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS top_winery,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No second winery') AS second_winery,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 3 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No third winery') AS third_winery
FROM RankedWineries
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country ASC; -- Order the final output by country
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY country ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final results alphabetically by the country name.

This query correctly calculates total points per winery, ranks them within each country, pivots the top 3 ranks into columns, handles missing ranks with specific strings, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH WineryTotalPoints AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        winery,
        SUM(points) AS total_points
    FROM Wineries
    GROUP BY country, winery
),
RankedWineries AS (
    SELECT
        country,
        winery,
        total_points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country ORDER BY total_points DESC, winery ASC) as rnk
    FROM WineryTotalPoints
)
SELECT
    country,
    MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 1 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END) AS top_winery,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 2 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No second winery') AS second_winery,
    COALESCE(MAX(CASE WHEN rnk = 3 THEN CONCAT(winery, ' (', total_points, ')') END), 'No third winery') AS third_winery
FROM RankedWineries
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country ASC;
