**Description**

Table: `Votes`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| voter       | varchar |
| candidate   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(voter, candidate) is the primary key (combination of unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains name of the voter and their candidate.
```

The election is conducted in a city where everyone can vote for **one or more** candidates or choose **not** to vote. Each person has `1` **vote** so if they vote for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across them. For example, if a person votes for `2` candidates, these candidates receive an equivalent of `0.5`Â votes each.

Write a solution to find `candidate` who got the most votes and won the election. Output the name of the **candidate** or If multiple candidates have an **equal number** of votes, display the names of all of them.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `candidate` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Votes table:
+----------+-----------+
| voter    | candidate |
+----------+-----------+
| Kathy    | null      |
| Charles  | Ryan      |
| Charles  | Christine |
| Charles  | Kathy     |
| Benjamin | Christine |
| Anthony  | Ryan      |
| Edward   | Ryan      |
| Terry    | null      |
| Evelyn   | Kathy     |
| Arthur   | Christine |
+----------+-----------+
Output:
+-----------+
| candidate |
+-----------+
| Christine |
| Ryan      |
+-----------+
Explanation:
- Kathy and Terry opted not to participate in voting, resulting in their votes being recorded as 0. Charles distributed his vote among three candidates, equating to 0.33 for each candidate. On the other hand, Benjamin, Arthur, Anthony, Edward, and Evelyn each cast their votes for a single candidate.
- Collectively, Candidate Ryan and Christine amassed a total of 2.33 votes, while Kathy received a combined total of 1.33 votes.
Since Ryan and Christine received an equal number of votes, we will display their names in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the candidate or candidates who received the highest total vote count. The rule is that each voter has 1 total vote, which is split equally among the candidates they vote for in non-null entries.

We will work with the `Votes` table.

Step 1: First, we need to identify the votes that actually count. Votes where the `candidate` is `null` don't contribute to any candidate's tally. So, we only care about rows where `candidate` is not `null`.

```SQL
SELECT
    voter,
    candidate
FROM Votes
WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL;
-- This selects only the votes cast for an actual candidate, ignoring null entries.
```

Explanation: We select the `voter` and `candidate` from the `Votes` table, but we filter the results using `WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL`. This ensures we only consider votes that were cast for a specific candidate.

Step 2: For each voter who cast at least one valid vote (from Step 1), we need to know how many candidates they voted for. This count will be the denominator when we split their 1 vote. We can get this by grouping the valid votes by `voter` and counting the distinct candidates they voted for.

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS (
    SELECT
        voter,
        candidate
    FROM Votes
    WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    voter,
    COUNT(candidate) AS num_candidates_voted_for
FROM ValidVotes
GROUP BY voter;
-- This calculates, for each voter who cast any valid votes, how many different candidates they voted for.
```

Explanation: We put the result from Step 1 into a CTE named `ValidVotes`. Then, in a new query using `ValidVotes`, we group the rows by `voter` and use `COUNT(candidate)` to count the number of valid candidates each voter selected. This count tells us how many ways each voter's single vote is split.

Step 3: Now we can calculate the fractional vote value for each specific vote. We join the list of valid votes (from `ValidVotes`) back with the count of candidates each voter voted for (from the query in Step 2). Each vote for a specific candidate by a specific voter is worth `1 / num_candidates_voted_for` votes. We use a DECIMAL type and `1.0` to ensure floating-point division for accuracy.

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
VoterVoteCounts AS (
    SELECT
        voter,
        COUNT(candidate) AS num_candidates_voted_for
    FROM ValidVotes
    GROUP BY voter
)
SELECT
    vv.candidate,
    -- Calculate the fractional vote value for this specific vote
    CAST(1.0 AS DECIMAL(10, 5)) / vvc.num_candidates_voted_for AS fractional_vote
FROM ValidVotes vv
JOIN VoterVoteCounts vvc ON vv.voter = vvc.voter;
-- This calculates the value of each individual vote (e.g., 0.5, 0.333...).
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `VoterVoteCounts` from the query in Step 2. Then, we join `ValidVotes` (aliased `vv`) with `VoterVoteCounts` (aliased `vvc`) on the `voter` column. For each row (which represents a vote by a voter for a specific candidate), we calculate the `fractional_vote` by dividing `1.0` (cast as DECIMAL for precision) by the voter's total count of candidates (`vvc.num_candidates_voted_for`).

Step 4: To find the total votes for each candidate, we sum up all the `fractional_vote` values for each candidate.

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
VoterVoteCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FractionalVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
CandidateTotalVotes AS (
    SELECT
        candidate,
        SUM(fractional_vote) AS total_candidate_votes
    FROM FractionalVotes
    GROUP BY candidate
)
-- This CTE sums up all the fractional votes for each candidate to get their total vote count.
```

Explanation: We create a fourth CTE `CandidateTotalVotes` from the result of Step 3. We group the results by `candidate` and use `SUM(fractional_vote)` to get the total number of votes each candidate received.

Step 5: Now we need to find the maximum total vote count among all candidates. We can use a window function to rank the candidates based on their total votes. `DENSE_RANK()` is suitable because it assigns the same rank to candidates with tied vote counts and does not skip rank numbers. We'll order by total votes descending to give rank 1 to the highest vote counts.

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
VoterVoteCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FractionalVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
CandidateTotalVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 4
RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        candidate,
        total_candidate_votes,
        -- Rank candidates by their total votes, highest first
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_candidate_votes DESC) as vote_rank
    FROM CandidateTotalVotes
)
-- This CTE ranks each candidate based on their total vote count. The candidate(s) with the highest count get rank 1.
```

Explanation: We create a fifth CTE `RankedCandidates` from the `CandidateTotalVotes` CTE. We use the `DENSE_RANK()` window function over the result.

- `ORDER BY total_candidate_votes DESC`: This orders the candidates within the window by their total votes from highest to lowest.
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns a rank. The candidate(s) with the highest vote count get rank 1. If multiple candidates tie for the highest count, they all get rank 1. The next rank assigned would be 2 (if there are candidates with the second-highest vote count), and so on.

Step 6: Finally, we select the `candidate` names from the `RankedCandidates` CTE where the `vote_rank` is 1 (meaning they tied for the highest total vote count). We then order the final result by candidate name in ascending order as required.

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
VoterVoteCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FractionalVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
CandidateTotalVotes AS ( ... ), -- from step 4
RankedCandidates AS ( ... ) -- from step 5
SELECT
    candidate
FROM RankedCandidates
WHERE vote_rank = 1 -- Select only the candidates who ranked 1 (the winners)
ORDER BY candidate ASC; -- Order the final output by candidate name
```

Explanation: We select the `candidate` column from the `RankedCandidates` CTE. The `WHERE vote_rank = 1` clause filters the result to include only those candidates who had the highest total vote count (rank 1). Finally, `ORDER BY candidate ASC` sorts the names of the winning candidates alphabetically.

This query correctly calculates the vote totals considering the splitting rule, identifies the maximum total, and returns all candidates who achieved that maximum, ordered by name.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH ValidVotes AS (
    SELECT
        voter,
        candidate
    FROM Votes
    WHERE candidate IS NOT NULL
),
VoterVoteCounts AS (
    SELECT
        voter,
        COUNT(candidate) AS num_candidates_voted_for
    FROM ValidVotes
    GROUP BY voter
),
FractionalVotes AS (
    SELECT
        vv.candidate,
        CAST(1.0 AS DECIMAL(10, 5)) / vvc.num_candidates_voted_for AS fractional_vote
    FROM ValidVotes vv
    JOIN VoterVoteCounts vvc ON vv.voter = vvc.voter
),
CandidateTotalVotes AS (
    SELECT
        candidate,
        SUM(fractional_vote) AS total_candidate_votes
    FROM FractionalVotes
    GROUP BY candidate
),
RankedCandidates AS (
    SELECT
        candidate,
        total_candidate_votes,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_candidate_votes DESC) as vote_rank
    FROM CandidateTotalVotes
)
SELECT
    candidate
FROM RankedCandidates
WHERE vote_rank = 1
ORDER BY candidate ASC;
```
