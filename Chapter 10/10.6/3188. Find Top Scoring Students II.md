**Explanation:**

- Alice (student_id 1) is a Computer Science major and has taken both Algorithms and Data Structures, receiving an A in both. She has also  
    taken Machine Learning and Operating Systems as electives, receiving an  
    A and B respectively.  
    
- Bob (student_id 2) is a Computer Science major but did not receive an A in all required courses.
- Charlie (student_id 3) is a Mathematics major and has taken both  
    Calculus and Linear Algebra, receiving an A in both. He has also taken  
    Probability and Statistics as electives, receiving an A and  
    B respectively.  
    
- David (student_id 4) is a Mathematics major but did not receive an A in all required courses.

**Note:** Output table is ordered by student_id in ascending order.

  

Let’s break down the solution step-by-step, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find students who meet the following criteria:

1. **Mandatory Courses**: Taken all mandatory courses in their major.
2. **Elective Courses**: Taken at least two elective courses in their major.
3. **Grades**: Achieved an **A** in all mandatory courses and at least **B** in elective courses.
4. **GPA**: Maintained an average GPA of at least **2.5** across all courses.

**Key Points:**

1. Identify mandatory and elective courses for each major.
2. Check if students meet the course and grade requirements.
3. Calculate and verify the average GPA.

---

### **Step 2: Identify Mandatory and Elective Courses**

First, separate mandatory and elective courses for each major.

```SQL
SELECT
    c.course_id,
    c.major,
    c.mandatory
FROM
    courses c;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**mandatory**`: Indicates whether a course is mandatory (`'Yes'`) or elective (`'No'`).

---

### **Step 3: Count Mandatory and Elective Courses Taken by Each Student**

Next, count how many mandatory and elective courses each student has taken in their major.

```SQL
WITH MandatoryElective AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        s.major,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.mandatory = 'Yes' THEN e.course_id END) AS mandatory_courses,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.mandatory = 'No' THEN e.course_id END) AS elective_courses
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id, s.major
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**COUNT(DISTINCT CASE ...)**`: Counts mandatory and elective courses separately.
- `**WHERE c.major = s.major**`: Filters courses to match the student’s major.

---

### **Step 4: Verify Grades for Mandatory and Elective Courses**

Now, verify that the student received an **A** in all mandatory courses and at least **B** in elective courses.

```SQL
, MandatoryGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS mandatory_A
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND c.mandatory = 'Yes'
        AND e.grade = 'A'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
),
ElectiveGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS elective_B_or_higher
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND c.mandatory = 'No'
        AND e.grade >= 'B'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**mandatory_A**`: Counts mandatory courses with grade **A**.
- `**elective_B_or_higher**`: Counts elective courses with grade **B** or higher.

---

### **Step 5: Calculate Average GPA**

Calculate the average GPA for each student across all courses.

```SQL
, AverageGPA AS (
    SELECT
        e.student_id,
        AVG(e.GPA) AS avg_gpa
    FROM
        enrollments e
    GROUP BY
        e.student_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**AVG(e.GPA)**`: Calculates the average GPA for each student.

---

### **Step 6: Combine and Filter Results**

Combine all the above calculations and filter students who meet all criteria.

```SQL
SELECT
    s.student_id
FROM
    students s
JOIN
    MandatoryElective me ON s.student_id = me.student_id
JOIN
    MandatoryGrades mg ON s.student_id = mg.student_id
JOIN
    ElectiveGrades eg ON s.student_id = eg.student_id
JOIN
    AverageGPA ag ON s.student_id = ag.student_id
JOIN
    (SELECT
         major,
         COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) AS total_mandatory
     FROM
         courses
     WHERE
         mandatory = 'Yes'
     GROUP BY
         major) mc ON s.major = mc.major
WHERE
    me.mandatory_courses = mc.total_mandatory
    AND me.elective_courses >= 2
    AND mg.mandatory_A = mc.total_mandatory
    AND eg.elective_B_or_higher >= me.elective_courses
    AND ag.avg_gpa >= 2.5
ORDER BY
    s.student_id;
```

**Explanation:**

1. `**JOIN**`: Combines all CTEs and subqueries.
2. `**WHERE**`: Filters students who meet all criteria:
    - Taken all mandatory courses.
    - Taken at least two elective courses.
    - Achieved **A** in all mandatory courses and **B** or higher in electives.
    - Maintained an average GPA of at least **2.5**.

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH MandatoryElective AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        s.major,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.mandatory = 'Yes' THEN e.course_id END) AS mandatory_courses,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN c.mandatory = 'No' THEN e.course_id END) AS elective_courses
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id, s.major
),
MandatoryGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS mandatory_A
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND c.mandatory = 'Yes'
        AND e.grade = 'A'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
),
ElectiveGrades AS (
    SELECT
        s.student_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT e.course_id) AS elective_B_or_higher
    FROM
        students s
    JOIN
        enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    JOIN
        courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
    WHERE
        c.major = s.major
        AND c.mandatory = 'No'
        AND e.grade >= 'B'
    GROUP BY
        s.student_id
),
AverageGPA AS (
    SELECT
        e.student_id,
        AVG(e.GPA) AS avg_gpa
    FROM
        enrollments e
    GROUP BY
        e.student_id
)
SELECT
    s.student_id
FROM
    students s
JOIN
    MandatoryElective me ON s.student_id = me.student_id
JOIN
    MandatoryGrades mg ON s.student_id = mg.student_id
JOIN
    ElectiveGrades eg ON s.student_id = eg.student_id
JOIN
    AverageGPA ag ON s.student_id = ag.student_id
JOIN
    (SELECT
         major,
         COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) AS total_mandatory
     FROM
         courses
     WHERE
         mandatory = 'Yes'
     GROUP BY
         major) mc ON s.major = mc.major
WHERE
    me.mandatory_courses = mc.total_mandatory
    AND me.elective_courses >= 2
    AND mg.mandatory_A = mc.total_mandatory
    AND eg.elective_B_or_higher >= me.elective_courses
    AND ag.avg_gpa >= 2.5
ORDER BY
    s.student_id;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Joins**: Combine data from multiple tables.
3. **Filters**: Ensure students meet all criteria.
4. **Order**: Sorts the result by `student_id`.

This query returns the `student_id` of students who meet all the specified criteria, ordered by `student_id`.
