**Description**

Table: `Teams`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
team_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about one team in the league.
```

Table: `Matches`

```Plain
+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| home_team_id    | int     |
| away_team_id    | int     |
| home_team_goals | int     |
| away_team_goals | int     |
+-----------------+---------+
(home_team_id, away_team_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about one match.
home_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the home team.
away_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the away team.
The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.
```

Write a solution to report the statistics of the league. The statistics should be built using the played matches where the **winning** team gets **three points** and the **losing** team gets **no points**. If a match ends with a **draw**, both teams get **one point**.

Each row of the result table should contain:

- `team_name` - The name of the team in the `Teams` table.
- `matches_played` - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.
- `points` - The total points the team has so far.
- `goal_for` - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.
- `goal_against` - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.
- `goal_diff` - The result of `goal_for - goal_against`.

Return the result table ordered by `points` **in descending order**. If two or more teams have the same `points`, order them by `goal_diff` **in descending order**. If there is still a tie, order them by `team_name` in **lexicographical order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Teams table:
+---------+-----------+
| team_id | team_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Ajax      |
| 4       | Dortmund  |
| 6       | Arsenal   |
+---------+-----------+
Matches table:
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
Output:
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |
| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |
| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
Explanation:
Ajax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws. Total points = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund (team_id=4) played 2 matches: 2 wins. Total points = 3 + 3 = 6.
Arsenal (team_id=6) played 2 matches: 2 draws. Total points = 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund is the first team in the table. Ajax and Arsenal have the same points, but since Arsenal has a higher goal_diff than Ajax, Arsenal comes before Ajax in the table.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step with clear explanations.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to calculate football/soccer league statistics for each team, including:

1. Matches played
2. Points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss)
3. Goals for (scored by the team)
4. Goals against (scored against the team)
5. Goal difference (goals for - goals against)

We need to order the results by points (descending), then goal difference (descending), then team name (alphabetically).

Let's break this down into steps:

## Step 1: Identify team appearances in matches

```SQL
SELECT team_id
FROM (
    SELECT home_team_id AS team_id FROM Matches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT away_team_id AS team_id FROM Matches
) AS all_teams
```

Explanation: First, we need to gather all team appearances in matches. We use UNION ALL to combine home teams and away teams into a single column.

## Step 2: Count matches played by each team

```SQL
SELECT
    team_id,
    COUNT(*) AS matches_played
FROM (
    SELECT home_team_id AS team_id FROM Matches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT away_team_id AS team_id FROM Matches
) AS all_teams
GROUP BY team_id
```

Explanation: We count how many times each team_id appears in the combined list to get matches_played.

## Step 3: Calculate team statistics separately for home and away matches

```SQL
WITH home_stats AS (
    SELECT
        home_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY home_team_id
),
away_stats AS (
    SELECT
        away_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN away_team_goals > home_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN away_team_goals = home_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY away_team_id
)
```

Explanation: We create two CTEs (Common Table Expressions):

1. `home_stats`: Calculate statistics when teams play at home
2. `away_stats`: Calculate statistics when teams play away

In each CTE, we:

- Group by the team ID
- Count matches played
- Sum points based on match results
- Sum goals scored (goal_for)
- Sum goals conceded (goal_against)

## Step 4: Combine home and away statistics

```SQL
WITH home_stats AS (
    SELECT
        home_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY home_team_id
),
away_stats AS (
    SELECT
        away_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN away_team_goals > home_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN away_team_goals = home_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY away_team_id
),
combined_stats AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        SUM(matches_played) AS matches_played,
        SUM(points) AS points,
        SUM(goal_for) AS goal_for,
        SUM(goal_against) AS goal_against,
        SUM(goal_for) - SUM(goal_against) AS goal_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM home_stats
        UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM away_stats
    ) AS all_stats
    GROUP BY team_id
)
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE called `combined_stats` that combines the home and away statistics. We use UNION ALL to combine the data and then group by team_id to aggregate the statistics.

## Step 5: Join with Teams table and apply ordering

```SQL
WITH home_stats AS (
    SELECT
        home_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY home_team_id
),
away_stats AS (
    SELECT
        away_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN away_team_goals > home_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN away_team_goals = home_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY away_team_id
),
combined_stats AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        SUM(matches_played) AS matches_played,
        SUM(points) AS points,
        SUM(goal_for) AS goal_for,
        SUM(goal_against) AS goal_against,
        SUM(goal_for) - SUM(goal_against) AS goal_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM home_stats
        UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM away_stats
    ) AS all_stats
    GROUP BY team_id
)
SELECT
    t.team_name,
    c.matches_played,
    c.points,
    c.goal_for,
    c.goal_against,
    c.goal_diff
FROM combined_stats c
JOIN Teams t ON c.team_id = t.team_id
ORDER BY c.points DESC, c.goal_diff DESC, t.team_name ASC
```

Explanation: Finally, we join the combined statistics with the Teams table to get the team names, and apply the ordering as specified: points descending, goal_diff descending, and team_name ascending.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH home_stats AS (
    SELECT
        home_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN home_team_goals > away_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN home_team_goals = away_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY home_team_id
),
away_stats AS (
    SELECT
        away_team_id AS team_id,
        COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
        SUM(CASE
            WHEN away_team_goals > home_team_goals THEN 3
            WHEN away_team_goals = home_team_goals THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END) AS points,
        SUM(away_team_goals) AS goal_for,
        SUM(home_team_goals) AS goal_against
    FROM Matches
    GROUP BY away_team_id
),
combined_stats AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        SUM(matches_played) AS matches_played,
        SUM(points) AS points,
        SUM(goal_for) AS goal_for,
        SUM(goal_against) AS goal_against,
        SUM(goal_for) - SUM(goal_against) AS goal_diff
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM home_stats
        UNION ALL
        SELECT * FROM away_stats
    ) AS all_stats
    GROUP BY team_id
)
SELECT
    t.team_name,
    c.matches_played,
    c.points,
    c.goal_for,
    c.goal_against,
    c.goal_diff
FROM combined_stats c
JOIN Teams t ON c.team_id = t.team_id
ORDER BY c.points DESC, c.goal_diff DESC, t.team_name ASC
```

This solution:

1. Calculates home statistics (when teams play at home)
2. Calculates away statistics (when teams play away)
3. Combines home and away statistics
4. Joins with the Teams table to get team names
5. Orders the results as required

The query handles all the requirements: counting matches played, calculating points based on match results, computing goals for and against, calculating goal difference, and ordering the results correctly.
