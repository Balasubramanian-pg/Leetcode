**Description**

Table `Person`:

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| id             | int     |
| name           | varchar |
| phone_number   | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name of a person and their phone number.
Phone number will be in the form 'xxx-yyyyyyy' where xxx is the country code (3 characters) and yyyyyyy is the phone number (7 characters) where x and y are digits. Both can contain leading zeros.
```

Table `Country`:

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| name           | varchar |
| country_code   | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
country_code is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the country name and its code. country_code will be in the form 'xxx' where x is digits.
```

Table `Calls`:

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| caller_id   | int  |
| callee_id   | int  |
| duration    | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table contains the caller id, callee id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id != callee_id
```

A telecommunications company wants to invest in new  
countries. The company intends to invest in the countries where the  
average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater  
than the global average call duration.  

Write a solution to find the countries where this company can invest.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Person table:
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | name     | phone_number |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 3  | Jonathan | 051-1234567  |
| 12 | Elvis    | 051-7654321  |
| 1  | Moncef   | 212-1234567  |
| 2  | Maroua   | 212-6523651  |
| 7  | Meir     | 972-1234567  |
| 9  | Rachel   | 972-0011100  |
+----+----------+--------------+
Country table:
+----------+--------------+
| name     | country_code |
+----------+--------------+
| Peru     | 051          |
| Israel   | 972          |
| Morocco  | 212          |
| Germany  | 049          |
| Ethiopia | 251          |
+----------+--------------+
Calls table:
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| caller_id | callee_id | duration |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
| 1         | 9         | 33       |
| 2         | 9         | 4        |
| 1         | 2         | 59       |
| 3         | 12        | 102      |
| 3         | 12        | 330      |
| 12        | 3         | 5        |
| 7         | 9         | 13       |
| 7         | 1         | 3        |
| 9         | 7         | 1        |
| 1         | 7         | 7        |
+-----------+-----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+
| country  |
+----------+
| Peru     |
+----------+
Explanation:
The average call duration for Peru is (102 + 102 + 330 + 330 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 145.666667
The average call duration for Israel is (33 + 4 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 7) / 8 = 9.37500
The average call duration for Morocco is (33 + 4 + 59 + 59 + 3 + 7) / 6 = 27.5000
Global call duration average = (2 * (33 + 4 + 59 + 102 + 330 + 5 + 13 + 3 + 1 + 7)) / 20 = 55.70000
Since Peru is the only country where the average call duration is greater than the global average, it is the only recommended country.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Equi-Join + Group By + Subquery**

We can use an equi-join to join the `Person` table and the `Calls` table on the condition of `Person.id = Calls.caller_id` or `Person.id = Calls.callee_id`, and then join the result with the `Country` table on the condition of `left(phone_number, 3) = country_code`.  
After that, we can group by country and calculate the average call  
duration for each country. Finally, we can use a subquery to find the  
countries whose average call duration is greater than the global average  
call duration.  

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT country
FROM
    (
        SELECT c.name AS country, AVG(duration) AS duration
        FROM
            Person
            JOIN Calls ON id IN(caller_id, callee_id)
            JOIN Country AS c ON LEFT(phone_number, 3) = country_code
        GROUP BY 1
    ) AS t
WHERE duration > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM Calls);
```

**Solution 2**

**MySQL**

```Plain
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    T AS (
        SELECT c.name AS country, AVG(duration) AS duration
        FROM
            Person
            JOIN Calls ON id IN(caller_id, callee_id)
            JOIN Country AS c ON LEFT(phone_number, 3) = country_code
        GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT country
FROM T
WHERE duration > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM Calls);
```

I'll create a SQL solution to find countries where the average call duration is strictly greater than the global average call duration.

Analyzing the problem:

1. We need to extract country codes from phone numbers
2. Calculate the average call duration per country
3. Calculate the global average call duration
4. Compare country averages with the global average

Here's my solution:

```SQL
WITH CountryCalls AS (
    -- Join calls with persons and double-count each call
    -- since both caller and callee are considered for country stats
    SELECT
        c.name AS country,
        ca.duration
    FROM
        Calls ca
    JOIN
        Person p ON p.id IN (ca.caller_id, ca.callee_id)
    JOIN
        Country c ON LEFT(p.phone_number, 3) = c.country_code
),
CountryAverages AS (
    -- Calculate average duration per country
    SELECT
        country,
        AVG(duration) AS avg_duration
    FROM
        CountryCalls
    GROUP BY
        country
)
-- Select countries with above-global-average call duration
SELECT
    country
FROM
    CountryAverages
WHERE
    avg_duration > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM Calls);
```

This solution:

1. Creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) called `CountryCalls` that:
    - Joins the Calls table with the Person table on both caller_id and callee_id
    - Joins with the Country table to get the country for each person
    - Extracts the country code from the phone_number using LEFT() function
2. Creates another CTE called `CountryAverages` that:
    - Groups the calls by country
    - Calculates the average call duration for each country
3. Selects countries from `CountryAverages` where:
    - The country's average call duration is greater than the global average

Note that we count each call twice (once for the caller and once for the callee) since the problem calculates averages based on each participant's country, not the call itself.

Following the example data, Peru would be the only country selected because its average call duration (145.67) is the only one greater than the global average (55.7).
