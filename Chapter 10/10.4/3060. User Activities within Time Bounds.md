**Description**

Table: `Sessions`

```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| user_id       | int      |
| session_start | datetime |
| session_end   | datetime |
| session_id    | int      |
| session_type  | enum     |
+---------------+----------+
session_id is column of unique values for this table.
session_type is an ENUM (category) type of (Viewer, Streamer).
This table contains user id, session start, session end, session id and session type.
```

Write a solution to find the the **users** who have had **at least one consecutive session** of the **same** type (either '**Viewer**' or '**Streamer**') with a **maximum** gap of `12` hours **between** sessions.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

```Plain
Input:
Sessions table:
+---------+---------------------+---------------------+------------+--------------+
| user_id | session_start       | session_end         | session_id | session_type |
+---------+---------------------+---------------------+------------+--------------+
| 101     | 2023-11-01 08:00:00 | 2023-11-01 09:00:00 | 1          | Viewer       |
| 101     | 2023-11-01 10:00:00 | 2023-11-01 11:00:00 | 2          | Streamer     |
| 102     | 2023-11-01 13:00:00 | 2023-11-01 14:00:00 | 3          | Viewer       |
| 102     | 2023-11-01 15:00:00 | 2023-11-01 16:00:00 | 4          | Viewer       |
| 101     | 2023-11-02 09:00:00 | 2023-11-02 10:00:00 | 5          | Viewer       |
| 102     | 2023-11-02 12:00:00 | 2023-11-02 13:00:00 | 6          | Streamer     |
| 101     | 2023-11-02 13:00:00 | 2023-11-02 14:00:00 | 7          | Streamer     |
| 102     | 2023-11-02 16:00:00 | 2023-11-02 17:00:00 | 8          | Viewer       |
| 103     | 2023-11-01 08:00:00 | 2023-11-01 09:00:00 | 9          | Viewer       |
| 103     | 2023-11-02 20:00:00 | 2023-11-02 23:00:00 | 10         | Viewer       |
| 103     | 2023-11-03 09:00:00 | 2023-11-03 10:00:00 | 11         | Viewer       |
+---------+---------------------+---------------------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 102     |
| 103     |
+---------+
Explanation:
- User ID 101 will not be included in the final output as they do not have any consecutive sessions of the same session type.
- User ID 102 will be included in the final output as they had two viewer sessions with session IDs 3 and 4, respectively, and the time gap between them was less than 12 hours.
- User ID 103 participated in two viewer sessions with a gap of less than 12 hours between them, identified by session IDs 10 and 11. Therefore, user 103 will be included in the final output.
Output table is ordered by user_id in increasing order.
```

To solve the problem, we need to identify users who have at least one pair of consecutive sessions of the same type with a gap of no more than 12 hours.

### **Approach:**

1. **Self Join the Sessions Table**: We will perform a self-join on the `Sessions` table where we compare each session with the next session for the same user and the same session type.
2. **Calculate Time Difference**: We need to calculate the time difference between the `session_end` of the first session and the `session_start` of the second session. If the gap is less than or equal to 12 hours, the sessions are considered consecutive.
3. **Filter by Session Type**: We must ensure the sessions are of the same type (`Viewer` or `Streamer`).
4. **Select Distinct User IDs**: Return distinct user IDs who have at least one such pair of consecutive sessions.
5. **Order the Result**: The result should be ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

### **SQL Query**:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT s1.user_id
FROM Sessions s1
JOIN Sessions s2
    ON s1.user_id = s2.user_id
    AND s1.session_type = s2.session_type
    AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, s1.session_end, s2.session_start) <= 12
    AND s1.session_id < s2.session_id
ORDER BY s1.user_id;
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Self Join**: We join the `Sessions` table with itself (`s1` and `s2`) on `user_id` and `session_type`. This allows us to compare each session with the next session for the same user and session type.
2. **Condition for 12-hour Gap**: The `TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, s1.session_end, s2.session_start) <= 12` condition ensures that the gap between `session_end` of the first session (`s1`) and `session_start` of the second session (`s2`) is at most 12 hours.
3. **Filter to Ensure Consecutive Sessions**: The condition `s1.session_id < s2.session_id` ensures that the first session (`s1`) comes before the second session (`s2`).
4. **Distinct Users**: We use `DISTINCT s1.user_id` to return unique users who meet the condition.
5. **Ordering**: Finally, we order the result by `s1.user_id` in ascending order.

### **Example Walkthrough**:

- **User 102**: They had two consecutive `Viewer` sessions with session IDs 3 and 4. The gap between the sessions is within the 12-hour limit, so they are included.
- **User 103**: They had two consecutive `Viewer` sessions with session IDs 10 and 11. The gap is also within the 12-hour limit, so they are included.
- **User 101**: They do not have any consecutive sessions with the same type and gap within 12 hours, so they are excluded.

### **Output**:

For the given example:

```Plain
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 102     |
| 103     |
+---------+
```

This solution efficiently identifies users who meet the condition of having consecutive sessions with the same type and within a 12-hour gap.
