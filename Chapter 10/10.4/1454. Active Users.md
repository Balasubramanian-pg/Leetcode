**Description**

Table: `Accounts`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
```

Table: `Logins`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
```

**Active users** are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.

Write a solution to find the id and the name of **active users**.

Return the result table **ordered** by `id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+
Output:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Explanation:
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
```

**Follow up:** Could you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for `n` or more consecutive days?

I'll write a solution to find active users who logged in for five or more consecutive days.

This problem requires:

1. Finding users who logged in for 5+ consecutive days
2. Returning their id and name ordered by id

The key insight is tracking consecutive login dates. One approach is to use the date subtraction trick with ROW_NUMBER():

```SQL
WITH DailyLogins AS (
    -- Get distinct login dates for each user
    SELECT DISTINCT id, login_date
    FROM Logins
),
ConsecutiveCheck AS (
    -- Calculate consecutive login pattern
    SELECT
        id,
        login_date,
        DATE_SUB(
            login_date,
            INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY login_date) DAY
        ) AS date_group
    FROM DailyLogins
)
SELECT DISTINCT a.id, a.name
FROM Accounts a
JOIN ConsecutiveCheck c ON a.id = c.id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, c.date_group
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY a.id;
```

This solution:

1. First creates a CTE to get distinct login dates for each user (since a user can log in multiple times per day)
2. Then creates another CTE that calculates a "date_group" by subtracting the row number from the login date
3. For consecutive dates, this calculation produces the same date_group value
4. Groups by id, name, and date_group, then counts login dates in each group
5. Filters for groups with 5 or more consecutive logins
6. Orders by id

For the follow-up question about generalizing for n consecutive days, we can simply change the HAVING clause to `HAVING COUNT(*) >= n`.

Looking at the example data, only user Jonathan (id=7) has 5 consecutive login days (May 30 to June 3), which matches the expected output.
