+-----------+-----------+
Explanation:
- The user with seller_id 2 has sold three items, but only two of them are not marked as a favorite. We will include a unique count of 1 because both of these items are identical.
- The user with seller_id 3 has sold two items, but only one of them is not marked as a favorite. We will include just that non-favorite item in our count.
Since seller_ids 2 and 3 have the same count of one item each, they both will be displayed in the output.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find the seller(s) who have sold the largest number of _unique_ items that are _not_ their favorite brand. If multiple sellers are tied for this highest number, we should list all of them, ordered by `seller_id`.

We need to connect information from three tables: `Users` (for seller's favorite brand), `Items` (for item brand), and `Orders` (to see which items were sold by which seller).

Step 1: We need to bring together the order information, the item details (specifically brand), and the seller's favorite brand. We can do this by joining the three tables: `Orders` to `Items` on `item_id`, and then to `Users` on `seller_id`.

```SQL
SELECT
    o.seller_id,
    o.item_id,
    u.favorite_brand,
    i.item_brand
FROM Orders o
JOIN Items i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
JOIN Users u ON o.seller_id = u.seller_id;
-- This joins all the necessary information for each order: the seller, the item sold, the item's brand, and the seller's favorite brand.
```

Explanation: We start by selecting from the `Orders` table (aliased `o`). We join it with the `Items` table (aliased `i`) using the `item_id` column, which exists in both. Then, we join the result with the `Users` table (aliased `u`) using the `seller_id` column. This brings together the `seller_id`, the `item_id` from the order, the `favorite_brand` of the seller, and the actual `item_brand` of the item sold for every order placed.

Step 2: From the joined data, we only care about orders where the `item_brand` is _not_ the same as the seller's `favorite_brand`. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter out orders for the seller's favorite brand.

```SQL
WITH RelevantSales AS (
    SELECT
        o.seller_id,
        o.item_id, -- We need item_id to count unique items
        u.favorite_brand, -- Keep for filtering logic clarity
        i.item_brand -- Keep for filtering logic clarity
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Items i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
    JOIN Users u ON o.seller_id = u.seller_id
    WHERE i.item_brand <> u.favorite_brand -- Filter for non-favorite brands
)
-- This CTE filters the joined data to include only sales where the item brand was different from the seller's favorite brand.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RelevantSales` containing the joined data from Step 1, but with a filter: `WHERE i.item_brand <> u.favorite_brand`. This means only rows where the item brand sold is different from the seller's favorite brand are included in this temporary result set.

Step 3: Now, for each seller, we need to count the _unique_ items (`item_id`) they sold that are in the `RelevantSales` CTE. We group the `RelevantSales` by `seller_id` and use `COUNT(DISTINCT item_id)`.

```SQL
WITH RelevantSales AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
SellerNonFavoriteCounts AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        -- Count the number of unique items sold that were not the seller's favorite brand
        COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) AS num_items
    FROM RelevantSales
    GROUP BY seller_id
)
-- This CTE calculates the count of unique non-favorite items sold for each seller who made such a sale.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `SellerNonFavoriteCounts` from the `RelevantSales` CTE. We group the rows by `seller_id` and use `COUNT(DISTINCT item_id)` to count the number of unique `item_id`s within each seller's group. This gives us the number of unique non-favorite items sold by each seller who sold at least one such item.

Step 4: We need to find the maximum `num_items` value among all sellers in the `SellerNonFavoriteCounts` CTE. Then, we select the sellers whose `num_items` matches this maximum. We can do this efficiently by ranking the sellers based on `num_items` descending and selecting those with rank 1. `RANK()` is suitable because it handles ties correctly.

```SQL
WITH RelevantSales AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
SellerNonFavoriteCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
RankedSellers AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        num_items,
        -- Rank sellers by their count of unique non-favorite items, highest first
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY num_items DESC) as rnk
    FROM SellerNonFavoriteCounts
)
-- This CTE ranks sellers based on the count of unique non-favorite items they sold. Rank 1 goes to the top seller(s).
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE `RankedSellers` from the `SellerNonFavoriteCounts` CTE. We add a column `rnk` using the `RANK()` window function.

- `ORDER BY num_items DESC`: This orders the sellers by their `num_items` count from highest to lowest.
- `RANK()`: Assigns a rank. The seller(s) with the highest `num_items` get rank 1. If there's a tie, they all get rank 1.

Step 5: Finally, we select the `seller_id` and `num_items` from the `RankedSellers` CTE where the rank (`rnk`) is 1, and order the result by `seller_id` ascendingly.

```SQL
WITH RelevantSales AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
SellerNonFavoriteCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
RankedSellers AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
SELECT
    seller_id,
    num_items
FROM RankedSellers
WHERE rnk = 1 -- Filter for sellers who are ranked 1 (the top seller(s))
ORDER BY seller_id ASC; -- Order the final output by seller ID
```

Explanation: We select the `seller_id` and `num_items` from the `RankedSellers` CTE. The `WHERE rnk = 1` clause keeps only the rows for the seller(s) who achieved the highest count of unique non-favorite items. Finally, `ORDER BY seller_id ASC` sorts the winning sellers by their ID in ascending order.

This query correctly identifies the top seller(s) based on the criteria, handles ties, and formats and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RelevantSales AS (
    SELECT
        o.seller_id,
        o.item_id
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Items i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
    JOIN Users u ON o.seller_id = u.seller_id
    WHERE i.item_brand <> u.favorite_brand
),
SellerNonFavoriteCounts AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) AS num_items
    FROM RelevantSales
    GROUP BY seller_id
),
RankedSellers AS (
    SELECT
        seller_id,
        num_items,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY num_items DESC) as rnk
    FROM SellerNonFavoriteCounts
)
SELECT
    seller_id,
    num_items
FROM RankedSellers
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY seller_id ASC;
```
