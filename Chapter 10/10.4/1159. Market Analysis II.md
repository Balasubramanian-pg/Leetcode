**Description**

Table: `Users`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| join_date      | date    |
| favorite_brand | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
This table has the info of the users of an online shopping website where users can sell and buy items.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| order_date    | date    |
| item_id       | int     |
| buyer_id      | int     |
| seller_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
item_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Items table.
buyer_id and seller_id are foreign keys to the Users table.
```

Table: `Items`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| item_id       | int     |
| item_brand    | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
item_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
```

Write a solution to find for each user whether the brand  
of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a  
user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no. It  
is guaranteed that no seller sells more than one item in a day.  

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

| 4         | no                 |
+-----------+--------------------+
Explanation:
The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem by breaking it down procedurally and explaining the solution step by step.

## Understanding the Problem

We need to determine if the second item (chronologically) sold by each user matches their favorite brand. The requirements are:

1. For each user, find the second item they sold (based on order date)
2. Check if that item's brand matches the user's favorite brand
3. If a user sold fewer than 2 items, report "no"
4. Return a table with seller_id and whether their second sold item matches their favorite brand (yes/no)

## Procedural Decomposition

Let's break down the solution into logical steps:

1. **Start with all users**: We need a result row for every user, even those who haven't sold anything
2. **Identify each user's second sale**: Rank each user's sales by date and filter for rank = 2
3. **Match with item information**: Join with the Items table to get the brand of the second sold item
4. **Compare with favorite brand**: Check if this brand matches the user's favorite brand
5. **Handle users with fewer than 2 sales**: Return "no" for these users

## SQL Solution Explanation

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id AS seller_id,
    CASE
        WHEN u.favorite_brand = i.item_brand THEN 'yes'
        ELSE 'no'
    END AS 2nd_item_fav_brand
FROM
    users AS u
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT
            order_date,
            item_id,
            seller_id,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY seller_id
                ORDER BY order_date
            ) AS rk
        FROM orders
    ) AS o
        ON u.user_id = o.seller_id AND o.rk = 2
    LEFT JOIN items AS i ON o.item_id = i.item_id;
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Base table: Users**
    - We start with the Users table (`u`) which contains all users and their favorite brands
    - This ensures every user will be included in the result
2. **Subquery to find each user's second sale**
    - The inner query uses a window function `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY seller_id ORDER BY order_date)`
    - This assigns a rank to each sale by a seller, ordered by date
    - Sales are grouped by seller_id (PARTITION BY) and ranked chronologically
    - This gives us each seller's first sale as rank 1, second sale as rank 2, etc.
3. **JOIN conditions**
    - We LEFT JOIN this subquery to the Users table, matching on user_id = seller_id
    - We add the condition `AND o.rk = 2` to only keep the second sale
    - LEFT JOIN ensures we keep all users, even those without a second sale
    - We then LEFT JOIN the Items table to get the brand of the second sold item
4. **Determine the output**
    - The CASE statement checks if user's favorite_brand matches the item_brand
    - If they match, output "yes"; otherwise, output "no"
    - For users without a second sale, i.item_brand will be NULL, so the CASE returns "no"

## Alternative Solution

Here's another way to solve this using a different approach that might be more intuitive for some:

```SQL
SELECT
    u.user_id AS seller_id,
    IF(
        COUNT(o.order_id) < 2, 'no',
        IF(
            i.item_brand = u.favorite_brand, 'yes', 'no'
        )
    ) AS 2nd_item_fav_brand
FROM
    Users u
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT seller_id, item_id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY seller_id ORDER BY order_date) AS sale_rank
    FROM Orders
) o ON u.user_id = o.seller_id AND o.sale_rank = 2
LEFT JOIN Items i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
GROUP BY u.user_id;
```

The key differences in this approach:

- Uses ROW_NUMBER() instead of RANK() (both work in this case since we're told no seller sells more than one item per day)
- Uses nested IF statements for clarity
- Includes a COUNT check to explicitly handle the "less than 2 items" condition

Both solutions produce the correct result, but the original one is slightly more concise and elegant.
