**Description**

Table: `LogInfo`

```Plain
+-------------+----------+
| Column Name | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| account_id  | int      |
| ip_address  | int      |
| login       | datetime |
| logout      | datetime |
+-------------+----------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
The table contains information about the login and logout dates of Leetflex accounts. It also contains the IP address from which the account was logged in and out.
It is guaranteed that the logout time is after the login time.
```

Write a solution to find the `account_id` of  
the accounts that should be banned from Leetflex. An account should be  
banned if it was logged in at some moment from two different IP  
addresses.  

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
LogInfo table:
+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| account_id | ip_address | login               | logout              |
+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1          | 1          | 2021-02-01 09:00:00 | 2021-02-01 09:30:00 |

Output:

Explanation:
Account ID 1 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 09:00:00" to "2021-02-01 09:30:00" with two different IP addresses (1 and 2). It should be banned.
Account ID 2 --> The account was active from two different addresses (6, 7) but intwo different times.
Account ID 3 --> The account was active from two different addresses (9, 13) on the same day butthey do not intersect at any moment.
Account ID 4 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 17:00:00" to "2021-02-01 17:00:00" with two different IP addresses (10 and 11). It should be banned.
```

## Solutions

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to find accounts that should be banned because they were logged in from two different IP addresses at the same time. This means we need to identify accounts where login/logout periods from different IP addresses overlap.

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Self-join the LogInfo table to find overlapping login periods

```SQL
SELECT
    l1.account_id,
    l1.ip_address AS ip1,
    l2.ip_address AS ip2,
    l1.login AS login1,
    l1.logout AS logout1,
    l2.login AS login2,
    l2.logout AS logout2
FROM
    LogInfo l1
JOIN
    LogInfo l2 ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id
WHERE
    l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address;
```

Explanation: We start by joining the LogInfo table with itself to find records for the same account but with different IP addresses. This gives us pairs of login records with different IPs for each account.

### Step 2: Add condition to check for overlapping time periods

```SQL
SELECT
    l1.account_id,
    l1.ip_address AS ip1,
    l2.ip_address AS ip2,
    l1.login AS login1,
    l1.logout AS logout1,
    l2.login AS login2,
    l2.logout AS logout2
FROM
    LogInfo l1
JOIN
    LogInfo l2 ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id
WHERE
    l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address
    AND l1.login <= l2.logout
    AND l2.login <= l1.logout;
```

Explanation: Now we add a condition to check if the login periods overlap. Two time periods overlap if the start of one period is earlier than or equal to the end of the other period, AND vice versa. This logic detects any time overlap between the two login sessions.

### Step 3: Remove duplicate pairs and get distinct account IDs

```SQL
SELECT
    DISTINCT l1.account_id
FROM
    LogInfo l1
JOIN
    LogInfo l2 ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id
WHERE
    l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address
    AND l1.login <= l2.logout
    AND l2.login <= l1.logout
    AND l1.ip_address < l2.ip_address;  -- To avoid counting each pair twice
```

Explanation: We add `DISTINCT` to get each account only once. We also add a condition `l1.ip_address < l2.ip_address` to avoid counting each pair twice (since our self-join would otherwise include both (IP1, IP2) and (IP2, IP1) for the same account).

### Step 4: Simplify the solution by removing unnecessary columns

```SQL
SELECT
    DISTINCT account_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        l1.account_id
    FROM
        LogInfo l1
    JOIN
        LogInfo l2 ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id
    WHERE
        l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address
        AND l1.login <= l2.logout
        AND l2.login <= l1.logout
) AS banned_accounts;
```

Explanation: We further simplify our solution by keeping only the account_id column that we need in the final result.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    DISTINCT l1.account_id
FROM
    LogInfo l1
JOIN
    LogInfo l2 ON l1.account_id = l2.account_id
WHERE
    l1.ip_address != l2.ip_address
    AND l1.login <= l2.logout
    AND l2.login <= l1.logout;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution. We join the LogInfo table with itself to find records for the same account but with different IP addresses. We then check if the login periods overlap by ensuring that the start of one period is earlier than or equal to the end of the other period, and vice versa. Finally, we use DISTINCT to get unique account IDs. This solution will correctly identify accounts that were logged in from different IP addresses at the same time.
