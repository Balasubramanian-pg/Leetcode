**Description**

Table: `Members`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| member_id   | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
member_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a member.
```

Table: `Visits`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| visit_id    | int  |
| member_id   | int  |
| visit_date  | date |
+-------------+------+
visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
member_id is a foreign key (reference column) to member_id from the Members table.
Each row of this table contains information about the date of a visit to the store and the member who visited it.
```

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+----------------+------+
| Column Name    | Type |
+----------------+------+
| visit_id       | int  |
| charged_amount | int  |
+----------------+------+
visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.
visit_id is a foreign key (reference column) to visit_id from the Visits table.
Each row of this table contains information about the amount charged in a visit to the store.
```

A store wants to categorize its members. There are three tiers:

- **"Diamond"**: if the conversion rate is **greater than or equal to** `80`.
- **"Gold"**: if the conversion rate is **greater than or equal to** `50` and less than `80`.
- **"Silver"**: if the conversion rate is **less than** `50`.
- **"Bronze"**: if the member never visited the store.

The **conversion rate** of a member is `(100 * total number of purchases for the member) / total number of visits for the member`.

Write a solution to report the id, the name, and the category of each member.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Members table:
+-----------+---------+
| member_id | name    |
+-----------+---------+
| 9         | Alice   |
| 11        | Bob     |
| 3         | Winston |
| 8         | Hercy   |
| 1         | Narihan |
+-----------+---------+
Visits table:
+----------+-----------+------------+

| 21       | 9         | 2021-05-12 |
+----------+-----------+------------+
Purchases table:
+----------+----------------+
| visit_id | charged_amount |
+----------+----------------+
| 12       | 2000           |
| 18       | 9000           |
| 17       | 7000           |
+----------+----------------+
Output:
+-----------+---------+----------+
| member_id | name    | category |
+-----------+---------+----------+
| 1         | Narihan | Bronze   |
| 3         | Winston | Silver   |
| 8         | Hercy   | Diamond  |
| 9         | Alice   | Gold     |
| 11        | Bob     | Silver   |
+-----------+---------+----------+
Explanation:
- User Narihan with id = 1 did not make any visits to the store. She gets a Bronze category.
- User Winston with id = 3 visited the store one time and did not purchase anything. The conversion rate = (100 * 0) / 1 = 0. He gets a Silver category.
- User Hercy with id = 8 visited the store one time and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 1 = 1. He gets a Diamond category.
- User Alice with id = 9 visited the store two times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 2 = 50. She gets a Gold category.
- User Bob with id = 11 visited the store three times and purchased one time. The conversion rate = (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33. He gets a Silver category.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, explaining each part of the solution.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to categorize store members based on their conversion rate:

1. Diamond: conversion rate ≥ 80
2. Gold: 50 ≤ conversion rate < 80
3. Silver: conversion rate < 50
4. Bronze: never visited the store

The conversion rate is calculated as: (100 × total purchases) / total visits.

Let's build the solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Count visits and purchases for each member

```SQL
WITH MemberStats AS (
    SELECT
        m.member_id,
        m.name,
        COUNT(v.visit_id) AS total_visits,
        COUNT(p.visit_id) AS total_purchases
    FROM Members m
    LEFT JOIN Visits v ON m.member_id = v.member_id
    LEFT JOIN Purchases p ON v.visit_id = p.visit_id
    GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
)
```

Explanation: This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the total visits and purchases for each member by joining the Members, Visits, and Purchases tables.

## Step 2: Calculate conversion rate and determine category

```SQL
WITH MemberStats AS (
    SELECT
        m.member_id,
        m.name,
        COUNT(v.visit_id) AS total_visits,
        COUNT(p.visit_id) AS total_purchases
    FROM Members m
    LEFT JOIN Visits v ON m.member_id = v.member_id
    LEFT JOIN Purchases p ON v.visit_id = p.visit_id
    GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
)
SELECT
    member_id,
    name,
    CASE
        WHEN total_visits = 0 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 80 THEN 'Diamond'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 50 THEN 'Gold'
        ELSE 'Silver'
    END AS category
FROM MemberStats
```

Explanation: Using the data from our CTE, we calculate the conversion rate for each member and assign the appropriate category based on the given criteria.

## Step 3: Handle edge cases and ensure correct calculation

The above solution has one potential issue - division by zero for members who never visited. Let's ensure our solution handles this correctly:

```SQL
WITH MemberStats AS (
    SELECT
        m.member_id,
        m.name,
        COUNT(v.visit_id) AS total_visits,
        COUNT(p.visit_id) AS total_purchases
    FROM Members m
    LEFT JOIN Visits v ON m.member_id = v.member_id
    LEFT JOIN Purchases p ON v.visit_id = p.visit_id
    GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
)
SELECT
    member_id,
    name,
    CASE
        WHEN total_visits = 0 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 80 THEN 'Diamond'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 50 THEN 'Gold'
        ELSE 'Silver'
    END AS category
FROM MemberStats
```

Actually, this solution already handles the edge case correctly. For members who never visited (total_visits = 0), the 'Bronze' category is assigned before attempting to calculate the conversion rate, avoiding division by zero.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH MemberStats AS (
    SELECT
        m.member_id,
        m.name,
        COUNT(v.visit_id) AS total_visits,
        COUNT(p.visit_id) AS total_purchases
    FROM Members m
    LEFT JOIN Visits v ON m.member_id = v.member_id
    LEFT JOIN Purchases p ON v.visit_id = p.visit_id
    GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
)
SELECT
    member_id,
    name,
    CASE
        WHEN total_visits = 0 THEN 'Bronze'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 80 THEN 'Diamond'
        WHEN (100.0 * total_purchases / total_visits) >= 50 THEN 'Gold'
        ELSE 'Silver'
    END AS category
FROM MemberStats
```

This solution works by:

1. Creating a CTE that counts the total visits and purchases for each member
2. Calculating the conversion rate using the formula (100 * total_purchases / total_visits)
3. Assigning the appropriate category based on the conversion rate
4. Handling the special case of members who never visited (Bronze category)

For the example data:

- Narihan (ID 1): 0 visits, 0 purchases → Bronze
- Winston (ID 3): 1 visit, 0 purchases → (100 * 0) / 1 = 0% → Silver
- Hercy (ID 8): 1 visit, 1 purchase → (100 * 1) / 1 = 100% → Diamond
- Alice (ID 9): 2 visits, 1 purchase → (100 * 1) / 2 = 50% → Gold
- Bob (ID 11): 3 visits, 1 purchase → (100 * 1) / 3 = 33.33% → Silver
