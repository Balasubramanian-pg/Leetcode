**Description**

Table: `Submissions`

```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| sub_id        | int      |
| parent_id     | int      |
+---------------+----------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments issub_id for another post in the table.
```

Write a solution to find the number of comments per post. The result table should contain `post_id` and its corresponding `number_of_comments`.

The `Submissions` table may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of **unique comments** per post.

The `Submissions` table may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The result table should be **ordered** by `post_id` in **ascending order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Submissions table:
+---------+------------+
| sub_id  | parent_id  |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |
+---------+------------+
Output:
+---------+--------------------+
| post_id | number_of_comments |
+---------+--------------------+
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+
Explanation:
The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4, and 9. The comment with id 3 is repeated in the table, we counted itonly once.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.
The post with id 12 has no comments in the table.
The comment with id 6 is a comment on a deleted post with id 7 so we ignored it.
```

Let's break this solution down step-by-step, using **structured decomposition**:

---

## **Objective**

Find the number of **unique comments per unique post**, from a table `Submissions` that may contain **duplicate posts and duplicate comments**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Decomposition**

### **1. Identify unique post-comment relationships**

```SQL
WITH t AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT s1.sub_id AS post_id, s2.sub_id AS sub_id
    FROM Submissions AS s1
    LEFT JOIN Submissions AS s2
        ON s1.sub_id = s2.parent_id
    WHERE s1.parent_id IS NULL
)
```

### **Explanation:**

- We alias the table `Submissions` twice: `s1` and `s2`.
- `s1`: Filters to only **posts** (`parent_id IS NULL`)
- `s2`: Joins on `s1.sub_id = s2.parent_id`, meaning: **comments where the parent is a post**
- `SELECT DISTINCT`: Ensures we **ignore duplicates** in the table (both posts and comments)

This gives us a list of **unique (post_id, comment_id)** pairs.

---

### **2. Aggregate the count of comments per post**

```SQL
SELECT post_id, COUNT(sub_id) AS number_of_comments
FROM t
GROUP BY post_id
ORDER BY post_id;
```

### **Explanation:**

- For each unique post, count how many unique comments it has.
- Posts with no comments will still be counted because of the **LEFT JOIN** in the CTE (`t`), where `sub_id` will be `NULL`.

---

## **Key Edge Cases Handled**

- **Duplicate posts**: Removed using `DISTINCT` in the `WITH` clause.
- **Duplicate comments**: Removed via the same `DISTINCT` logic.
- **Comments on deleted posts**: Handled by filtering only `s1.parent_id IS NULL` â€” so only valid posts are used as join base.
- **Posts with no comments**: Still included via `LEFT JOIN`.

---

## **Output**

Returns a table of `post_id` and `number_of_comments`, ordered by `post_id`.

---

## **Example Output (From Given Data)**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|post_id|number_of_comments|
|1|3|
|2|2|
|12|0|
