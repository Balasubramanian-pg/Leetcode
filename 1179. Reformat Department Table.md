Table: `Department`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| revenue     | int     |
| month       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
```

Reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column **for each month**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Department table:
+------+---------+-------+
| id   | revenue | month |
+------+---------+-------+
| 1    | 8000    | Jan   |
| 2    | 9000    | Jan   |
| 3    | 10000   | Feb   |
| 1    | 7000    | Feb   |
| 1    | 6000    | Mar   |
+------+---------+-------+
Output:
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| id   | Jan_Revenue | Feb_Revenue | Mar_Revenue | ... | Dec_Revenue |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| 1    | 8000        | 7000        | 6000        | ... | null        |
| 2    | 9000        | null        | null        | ... | null        |
| 3    | null        | 10000       | null        | ... | null        |
+------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
Explanation: The revenue from Apr to Dec is null.
Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).
```

# SQL Solution to Reformat Department Table

To transform the Department table from a long format to a wide format with separate columns for each month's revenue, I'll use a pivot operation with conditional aggregation.

```SQL
SELECT
    id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue END) AS May_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    MAX(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM
    Department
GROUP BY
    id
ORDER BY
    id;
```

## Explanation:

1. For each department ID, we create 12 columns (Jan_Revenue through Dec_Revenue)
2. The `CASE WHEN` statement checks if the month matches the column we're creating
3. If there's a match, it returns the revenue value; otherwise it returns NULL
4. The `MAX()` function is used as an aggregate function (since we're grouping by id) - it will pick the non-NULL value if one exists for that department/month combination
5. We `GROUP BY id` to ensure one row per department
6. The result will show NULL for months where a department had no revenue data

This approach effectively pivots the data from rows to columns, creating the requested output format with one column per month.
