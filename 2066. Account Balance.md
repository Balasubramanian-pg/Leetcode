**Description**

Table: `Transactions`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| day         | date |
| type        | ENUM |
| amount      | int  |
+-------------+------+
(account_id, day) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about one transaction, including the transaction type, the day it occurred on, and the amount.
type is an ENUM (category) of the type ('Deposit','Withdraw')
```

Write a solution to report the balance of each user after  
each transaction. You may assume that the balance of each account before  
any transaction is  
`0` and that the balance will never be below `0` at any moment.

Return the result table **in ascending order** by `account_id`, then by `day` in case of a tie.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Transactions table:
+------------+------------+----------+--------+
| account_id | day        | type     | amount |
+------------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1          | 2021-11-07 | Deposit  | 2000   |
| 1          | 2021-11-09 | Withdraw | 1000   |
| 1          | 2021-11-11 | Deposit  | 3000   |
| 2          | 2021-12-07 | Deposit  | 7000   |
| 2          | 2021-12-12 | Withdraw | 7000   |
+------------+------------+----------+--------+
Output:
+------------+------------+---------+
| account_id | day        | balance |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2021-11-07 | 2000    |
| 1          | 2021-11-09 | 1000    |
| 1          | 2021-11-11 | 4000    |
| 2          | 2021-12-07 | 7000    |
| 2          | 2021-12-12 | 0       |
+------------+------------+---------+
Explanation:
Account 1:
- Initial balance is 0.
- 2021-11-07 --> deposit 2000. Balance is 0 + 2000 = 2000.
- 2021-11-09 --> withdraw 1000. Balance is 2000 - 1000 = 1000.
- 2021-11-11 --> deposit 3000. Balance is 1000 + 3000 = 4000.
Account 2:
- Initial balance is 0.
- 2021-12-07 --> deposit 7000. Balance is 0 + 7000 = 7000.
- 2021-12-12 --> withdraw 7000. Balance is 7000 - 7000 = 0.
```

## Solutions

Let me solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part clearly along the way.

## Problem Understanding

In plain English, we need to:

1. Calculate the running balance for each account after each transaction
2. For deposits, we add to the balance
3. For withdrawals, we subtract from the balance
4. Return results sorted by account_id and then by day
5. The starting balance is 0 for all accounts

Let's build the solution incrementally:

## Step 1: Start with the basic structure and identify what we need

```SQL
SELECT
    account_id,
    day
FROM Transactions
ORDER BY account_id, day;
```

Explanation: We begin with selecting the account_id and day columns from the Transactions table, which will be part of our final output. We're also sorting as required in the problem - first by account_id and then by day.

## Step 2: Calculate the impact of each transaction on the balance

```SQL
SELECT
    account_id,
    day,
    CASE
        WHEN type = 'Deposit' THEN amount
        WHEN type = 'Withdraw' THEN -amount
    END AS transaction_impact
FROM Transactions
ORDER BY account_id, day;
```

Explanation: We need to convert the transaction type to a numeric impact on the balance. Deposits add to the balance (positive), and withdrawals reduce the balance (negative). The CASE statement helps us make this conversion.

## Step 3: Calculate the running balance using a window function

```SQL
SELECT
    account_id,
    day,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN type = 'Deposit' THEN amount
        WHEN type = 'Withdraw' THEN -amount
    END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY account_id
        ORDER BY day
    ) AS balance
FROM Transactions
ORDER BY account_id, day;
```

Explanation: Now we use the SUM window function with OVER clause to create a running total. The PARTITION BY account_id means we calculate the running total separately for each account. The ORDER BY day means we accumulate the sum chronologically. This gives us the balance after each transaction.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    account_id,
    day,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN type = 'Deposit' THEN amount
        WHEN type = 'Withdraw' THEN -amount
    END) OVER (
        PARTITION BY account_id
        ORDER BY day
    ) AS balance
FROM Transactions
ORDER BY account_id, day;
```

This query:

1. Converts each transaction to its impact on the balance (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals)
2. Calculates a running sum of these impacts for each account, ordered by date
3. Returns each account's balance after every transaction
4. Orders the results by account_id and then by day as required

The window function (SUM OVER) is the key here - it lets us create a running total without needing to use subqueries or self-joins, making the solution elegant and efficient.
