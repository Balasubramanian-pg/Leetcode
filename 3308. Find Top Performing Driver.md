Uber is analyzing drivers based on their trips. Write a solution to find the **top-performing driver** for **each fuel type** based on the following criteria:

1. A driver's performance is calculated as the **average rating** across all their trips. Average rating should be rounded to `2` decimal places.
2. If two drivers have the same average rating, the driver with the **longer total distance** traveled should be ranked higher.
3. If there is **still a tie**, choose the driver with the **fewest accidents**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `fuel_type` _in_ **ascending** _order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`Drivers` table:

```Plain
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
| driver_id | name     | age | experience | accidents |
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
| 1         | Alice    | 34  | 10         | 1         |
| 2         | Bob      | 45  | 20         | 3         |
| 3         | Charlie  | 28  | 5          | 0         |
+-----------+----------+-----+------------+-----------+
```

`Vehicles` table:

```Plain
+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
| vehicle_id | driver_id | model   | fuel_type | mileage |
+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
| 100        | 1         | Sedan   | Gasoline  | 20000   |
| 101        | 2         | SUV     | Electric  | 30000   |
| 102        | 3         | Coupe   | Gasoline  | 15000   |
+------------+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+
```

`Trips` table:

```Plain
+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
| trip_id | vehicle_id | distance | duration | rating |
+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
| 201     | 100        | 50       | 30       | 5      |
| 202     | 100        | 30       | 20       | 4      |
| 203     | 101        | 100      | 60       | 4      |
| 204     | 101        | 80       | 50       | 5      |
| 205     | 102        | 40       | 30       | 5      |
| 206     | 102        | 60       | 40       | 5      |
+---------+------------+----------+----------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| fuel_type | driver_id | rating | distance |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| Electric  | 2         | 4.50   | 180      |
| Gasoline  | 3         | 5.00   | 100      |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For fuel type `Gasoline`, both Alice (Driver 1) and  
    Charlie (Driver 3) have trips. Charlie has an average rating of 5.0,  
    while Alice has 4.5. Therefore, Charlie is selected.  
    
- For fuel type `Electric`, Bob (Driver 2) is the only driver with an average rating of 4.5, so he is selected.

The output table is ordered by `fuel_type` in ascending order.

I'll help you tackle this SQL interview problem step by step. Let's start breaking it down.

## [Clarification]

Before diving into the solution, I'd like to clarify a few things:

1. Are we guaranteed that each driver only operates vehicles with a single fuel type, or could a driver operate multiple vehicles with different fuel types?
2. Should we include drivers who have no trips in our results? If a driver has no trips, they would have no rating data.

Since this is an interview setting, let's proceed assuming that drivers may operate vehicles with different fuel types, and that we should only include drivers who have at least one trip.

## [Problem Analysis]

Let's outline what we need to do:

- **Inputs**: Three tables - Drivers, Vehicles, and Trips
- **Output**: A table with fuel_type, driver_id, average rating, and total distance
- **Task**: Find the top-performing driver for each fuel type based on:
    1. Highest average rating (rounded to 2 decimal places)
    2. If tied, highest total distance
    3. If still tied, fewest accidents
- **Order**: By fuel_type ascending

## [Approach]

Let's break this down into logical steps:

1. Join the three tables to connect trips to vehicles to drivers
2. Calculate each driver's performance metrics for each fuel type:
    - Average rating
    - Total distance
    - Number of accidents (already available in Drivers)
3. Rank drivers within each fuel type based on the criteria
4. Select the top driver for each fuel type

What do you think of this approach? Would you add or modify anything?

<Inner Monologue>  
Alright, let's break down this problem:  

1. We need to find the top-performing driver for each fuel type.
2. Performance is determined by:
    - First, the average rating across all trips (rounded to 2 decimal places)
    - In case of a tie, the driver with longer total distance traveled
    - If still tied, the driver with fewer accidents

We have three tables to work with:

- `Drivers`: Contains driver information including accidents
- `Vehicles`: Contains vehicle information including fuel type and driver association
- `Trips`: Contains trip information including ratings and distances

Let's develop a step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Join the three tables to get all the information we need.  
We'll need to connect  
`Trips` to `Vehicles` using `vehicle_id`, and then connect `Vehicles` to `Drivers` using `driver_id`.

Step 2: Calculate each driver's average rating and total distance for each fuel type.  
We need to:  

- Group by fuel_type and driver_id
- Calculate AVG(rating) rounded to 2 decimal places
- Calculate SUM(distance) for each group

Step 3: Find the top driver for each fuel type using our ranking criteria.  
This will require window functions to rank drivers within each fuel type based on:  

1. Average rating (descending)
2. Total distance (descending)
3. Number of accidents (ascending)

Step 4: Filter to only keep the top driver for each fuel type.

Step 5: Order the result by fuel_type in ascending order.

Let me work through this:

For the first part, I'll join the tables and calculate the metrics per driver and fuel type:

```SQL
SELECT
    v.fuel_type,
    v.driver_id,
    ROUND(AVG(t.rating), 2) AS avg_rating,
    SUM(t.distance) AS total_distance,
    d.accidents
FROM
    Vehicles v
JOIN
    Trips t ON v.vehicle_id = t.vehicle_id
JOIN
    Drivers d ON v.driver_id = d.driver_id
GROUP BY
    v.fuel_type, v.driver_id
```

Next, I need to rank each driver within their fuel type:

```SQL
SELECT
    fuel_type,
    driver_id,
    avg_rating,
    total_distance,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY fuel_type
        ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, total_distance DESC, accidents ASC
    ) AS driver_rank
FROM (
    -- The above query
) ranked_drivers
```

Finally, filter to only keep the top driver for each fuel type and order by fuel_type:

```SQL
SELECT
    fuel_type,
    driver_id,
    avg_rating AS rating,
    total_distance AS distance
FROM (
    -- The ranking query
) top_drivers
WHERE
    driver_rank = 1
ORDER BY
    fuel_type ASC
```

Wait, I need to check something here. Looking at the example output, it shows:

```Plain
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| fuel_type | driver_id | rating | distance |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
| Electric  | 2         | 4.50   | 180      |
| Gasoline  | 3         | 5.00   | 100      |
+-----------+-----------+--------+----------+
```

But the explanation mentions:

- For Gasoline: Charlie (Driver 3) has average rating 5.0, while Alice (Driver 1) has 4.5
- For Electric: Bob (Driver 2) has average rating 4.5

Let me trace through the example data:

For Alice (Driver 1):

- Trips with vehicle 100: ratings 5 and 4
- Average rating: (5+4)/2 = 4.5
- Total distance: 50+30 = 80

For Bob (Driver 2):

- Trips with vehicle 101: ratings 4 and 5
- Average rating: (4+5)/2 = 4.5
- Total distance: 100+80 = 180

For Charlie (Driver 3):

- Trips with vehicle 102: ratings 5 and 5
- Average rating: (5+5)/2 = 5.0
- Total distance: 40+60 = 100

This matches the explanation, so I'm confident in my approach.

Time to finalize the SQL solution:  
</Inner Monologue>  
  

```SQL
WITH driver_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        v.fuel_type,
        d.driver_id,
        ROUND(AVG(t.rating), 2) AS rating,
        SUM(t.distance) AS distance,
        d.accidents
    FROM 
        Vehicles v
    JOIN 
        Trips t ON v.vehicle_id = t.vehicle_id
    JOIN 
        Drivers d ON v.driver_id = d.driver_id
    GROUP BY 
        v.fuel_type, d.driver_id
),
ranked_drivers AS (
    SELECT 
        fuel_type,
        driver_id,
        rating,
        distance,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY fuel_type 
            ORDER BY rating DESC, distance DESC, accidents ASC
        ) AS driver_rank
    FROM 
        driver_metrics
)
SELECT 
    fuel_type,
    driver_id,
    rating,
    distance
FROM 
    ranked_drivers
WHERE 
    driver_rank = 1
ORDER BY 
    fuel_type ASC;
```

I approached this problem by breaking it down into steps:

1. First, I created a CTE called `driver_metrics` that joins all three tables (Vehicles, Trips, and Drivers) to:
    - Connect trips to vehicles and drivers
    - Calculate each driver's average rating (rounded to 2 decimal places)
    - Sum up the total distance traveled by each driver
    - Include the accident count for each driver
    - Group everything by fuel type and driver ID
2. Next, I created another CTE called `ranked_drivers` that:
    - Uses the RANK() window function to rank drivers within each fuel type
    - Implements the three-tier ranking system:
        - Primary sort: Average rating (highest first)
        - Tiebreaker 1: Total distance (highest first)
        - Tiebreaker 2: Number of accidents (lowest first)
3. Finally, in the main query, I:
    - Filter to only select the top-ranked driver (driver_rank = 1) for each fuel type
    - Order the results by fuel type in ascending order
    - Display only the required columns (fuel_type, driver_id, rating, distance)

This solution uses window functions to efficiently handle the ranking requirements without needing multiple subqueries or self-joins, making it both readable and performant.
