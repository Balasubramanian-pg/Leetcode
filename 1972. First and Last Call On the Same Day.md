**Description**

Table: `Calls`

```Plain
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| caller_id    | int      |
| recipient_id | int      |
| call_time    | datetime |
+--------------+----------+
(caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the time of a phone call between caller_id and recipient_id.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of the users whose first and last calls on **any day** were with **the same person**. Calls are counted regardless of being the caller or the recipient.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Calls table:
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 17:46:07 |
| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 19:57:13 |
| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 05:28:44 |
| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 04:04:15 |
| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 |
| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 22:22:22 |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 1       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
| 8       |
+---------+
Explanation:
On 2021-08-24, the first and last call of this day for user 8 was with user 4. User 8 should be included in the answer.
Similarly, user 4 on 2021-08-24 had their first and last call with user 8. User 4 should be included in the answer.
On 2021-08-11, user 1 and 5 had a call. This call was the only call for both of them on this day. Since this call is the first and last call of the day for both of them, they should both be included in the answer.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step, breaking it down into logical components.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Find users whose first and last calls on any day were with the same person
2. Count a user as being in a call regardless of whether they were the caller or recipient
3. Return the IDs of these users

Let's build this solution incrementally.

## Step 1: Normalize the calls data

```SQL
WITH NormalizedCalls AS (
    -- Convert the data to show each call from both perspectives
    SELECT caller_id AS user_id, recipient_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recipient_id AS user_id, caller_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
)
```

Explanation: First, we need to normalize the data so that each call appears twice - once from each participant's perspective. This way, we can easily track all calls for each user regardless of whether they were the caller or recipient.

## Step 2: Identify first and last calls for each user on each day

```SQL
WITH NormalizedCalls AS (
    SELECT caller_id AS user_id, recipient_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recipient_id AS user_id, caller_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
),
DailyCalls AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(call_time) AS call_date,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time) AS first_contact,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS last_contact
    FROM NormalizedCalls
)
```

Explanation: Using window functions, we identify the first and last contact for each user on each day. We partition by user_id and the date of the call, then order by call_time to get the first contact and by call_time DESC to get the last contact.

## Step 3: Filter for matching first and last contacts and get distinct users

```SQL
WITH NormalizedCalls AS (
    SELECT caller_id AS user_id, recipient_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recipient_id AS user_id, caller_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
),
DailyCalls AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(call_time) AS call_date,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time) AS first_contact,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS last_contact
    FROM NormalizedCalls
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM DailyCalls
WHERE first_contact = last_contact
```

Explanation: Finally, we filter to include only rows where the first and last contact are the same person, then get the distinct user IDs.

## Step 4: Final optimized solution

```SQL
WITH NormalizedCalls AS (
    SELECT caller_id AS user_id, recipient_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recipient_id AS user_id, caller_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
),
DailyCalls AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(call_time) AS call_date,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time) AS first_contact,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS last_contact
    FROM NormalizedCalls
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM DailyCalls
WHERE first_contact = last_contact
```

## Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH NormalizedCalls AS (
    SELECT caller_id AS user_id, recipient_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
    SELECT recipient_id AS user_id, caller_id AS contact_id, call_time
    FROM Calls
),
DailyCalls AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        DATE(call_time) AS call_date,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time) AS first_contact,
        FIRST_VALUE(contact_id) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id, DATE(call_time) ORDER BY call_time DESC) AS last_contact
    FROM NormalizedCalls
)
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM DailyCalls
WHERE first_contact = last_contact
```

This SQL solution works by:

1. Creating a NormalizedCalls CTE that considers each call from both users' perspectives
2. Creating a DailyCalls CTE that:
    - Groups calls by user and date
    - Uses window functions to find the first and last contact for each user on each day
3. Selecting only users whose first and last calls on any day were with the same person
4. Using DISTINCT to ensure each user appears only once in the result

When applied to the example data, this correctly identifies users 1, 4, 5, and 8 as having their first and last calls on some day with the same person:

- User 1: Only call on 2021-08-11 was with User 5
- User 4: First and last calls on 2021-08-24 were with User 8
- User 5: Only call on 2021-08-11 was with User 1
- User 8: First and last calls on 2021-08-24 were with User 4
