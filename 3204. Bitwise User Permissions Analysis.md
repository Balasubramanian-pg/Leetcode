**Description**

Table: `user_permissions`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| permissions | int     |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key.
Each row of this table contains the user ID and their permissions encoded as an integer.
```

Consider that each bit in the `permissions` integer represents a different access level or feature that a user has.

Write a solution to calculate the following:

- common_perms: The access level granted to **all users**. This is computed using a **bitwise AND** operation on the `permissions` column.
- any_perms: The access level granted to **any user**. This is computed using a **bitwise OR** operation on the `permissions` column.

Return _the result table in **any** order_.

The result format is shown in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

user_permissions table:

```Plain
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | permissions |
+---------+-------------+
| 1       | 5           |
| 2       | 12          |
| 3       | 7           |
| 4       | 3           |
+---------+-------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+--------------+
| common_perms | any_perms   |
+--------------+-------------+
| 0            | 15          |
+--------------+-------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **common_perms:** Represents the bitwise AND result of all permissions:
    
    ```Plain
    <ul>
    	<li>For user 1 (5): 5 (binary 0101)</li>
    	<li>For user 2 (12): 12 (binary 1100)</li>
    	<li>For user 3 (7): 7 (binary 0111)</li>
    	<li>For user 4 (3): 3 (binary 0011)</li>
    	<li>Bitwise AND: 5 &amp; 12 &amp; 7 &amp; 3 = 0 (binary 0000)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>any_perms:</strong> Represents the bitwise OR result of all permissions:
    <ul>
    	<li>Bitwise OR: 5 | 12 | 7 | 3 = 15 (binary 1111)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    ```
    

## Solutions

Letâ€™s break down the solution step-by-step, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to compute two values based on the `permissions` column:

1. **common_perms**: The bits that are **set (1)** in **all** users' permissions (bitwise AND).
2. **any_perms**: The bits that are **set (1)** in **any** user's permissions (bitwise OR).

**Key Points:**

- Use bitwise AND (`&`) to find common permissions.
- Use bitwise OR (`|`) to find any permissions.

---

### **Step 2: Compute Bitwise AND for Common Permissions**

To find `common_perms`, we perform a bitwise AND operation across all `permissions` values.

```SQL
SELECT
    BIT_AND(permissions) AS common_perms
FROM
    user_permissions;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**BIT_AND(permissions)**`: This function computes the bitwise AND of all values in the `permissions` column.
- The result is the bits that are **1** in **all** users' permissions.

---

### **Step 3: Compute Bitwise OR for Any Permissions**

To find `any_perms`, we perform a bitwise OR operation across all `permissions` values.

```SQL
SELECT
    BIT_OR(permissions) AS any_perms
FROM
    user_permissions;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**BIT_OR(permissions)**`: This function computes the bitwise OR of all values in the `permissions` column.
- The result is the bits that are **1** in **any** user's permissions.

---

### **Step 4: Combine Both Results**

Combine the results of the bitwise AND and OR operations into a single row.

```SQL
SELECT
    (SELECT BIT_AND(permissions) FROM user_permissions) AS common_perms,
    (SELECT BIT_OR(permissions) FROM user_permissions) AS any_perms;
```

**Explanation:**

- **Subqueries**: Each subquery computes one of the required values.
- The outer query combines both results into a single row.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
SELECT
    (SELECT BIT_AND(permissions) FROM user_permissions) AS common_perms,
    (SELECT BIT_OR(permissions) FROM user_permissions) AS any_perms;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **Bitwise AND**: Computes the common permissions using `BIT_AND`.
2. **Bitwise OR**: Computes the any permissions using `BIT_OR`.
3. **Subqueries**: Each subquery calculates one of the required values, and the outer query combines them into a single result row.

This query returns the `common_perms` and `any_perms` as specified in the problem.
