Write a solution to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The result table should have the `product_id` and `product_name` for each `customer_id` who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+-------------+-------+
| customer_id | name  |
+-------------+-------+
| 1           | Alice |
| 2           | Bob   |
| 3           | Tom   |
| 4           | Jerry |
| 5           | John  |
+-------------+-------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |
| 3        | 2020-08-29 | 3           | 3          |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 1          |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 2          |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 1          |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 3          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 3          | screen       |
| 3           | 3          | screen       |
| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
Explanation:
Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.
```

I'll solve this SQL problem to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The challenge is to:

1. Count how many times each customer ordered each product
2. Determine which product(s) have the highest order count for each customer
3. Return customer_id, product_id, and product_name for these most frequently ordered products

Here's my SQL solution:

```SQL
WITH ProductFrequency AS (
    SELECT
        o.customer_id,
        o.product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count
    FROM
        Orders o
    GROUP BY
        o.customer_id, o.product_id
),
MaxFrequency AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MAX(order_count) AS max_order_count
    FROM
        ProductFrequency
    GROUP BY
        customer_id
)
SELECT
    pf.customer_id,
    pf.product_id,
    p.product_name
FROM
    ProductFrequency pf
JOIN
    MaxFrequency mf ON pf.customer_id = mf.customer_id AND pf.order_count = mf.max_order_count
JOIN
    Products p ON pf.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY
    pf.customer_id, pf.product_id;
```

Let me walk through how this solution works:

1. `ProductFrequency` CTE:
    - Groups orders by customer_id and product_id
    - Counts how many times each customer ordered each product
2. `MaxFrequency` CTE:
    - For each customer, finds their maximum order count
3. Final query:
    - Joins the CTEs to get only products with the maximum order count for each customer
    - Joins with Products table to get the product_name
    - Returns customer_id, product_id, and product_name

This solution handles cases where a customer's most frequently ordered product isn't unique (like Bob who ordered three different products once each).

Looking at the example data:

- Alice (customer 1) ordered product 2 (mouse) three times and product 1 once, so only product 2 appears
- Bob (customer 2) ordered products 1, 2, and 3 once each, so all three appear
- Tom (customer 3) ordered product 3 twice, so only product 3 appears
- Jerry (customer 4) ordered product 1 once, so only product 1 appears
- John (customer 5) made no orders, so is not included

The result matches the expected output from the example.
