**Description**

Table: `Coordinates`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| X           | int  |
| Y           | int  |
+-------------+------+
Each row includes X and Y, where both are integers. Table may contain duplicate values.
```

Two coordindates `(X1, Y1)` and `(X2, Y2)` are said to be **symmetric** coordintes if `X1 == Y2` and `X2 == Y1`.

Write a solution that outputs, among all these **symmetric coordintes**, only those **unique** coordinates that satisfy the condition `X1 <= Y1`.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `X` _and_ `Y` _(respectively) in **ascending order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Coordinates table:
+----+----+
| X  | Y  |
+----+----+
| 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 21 |
| 23 | 22 |
| 22 | 23 |
| 21 | 20 |
+----+----+
Output:
+----+----+
| x  | y  |
+----+----+
| 20 | 20 |
| 20 | 21 |
| 22 | 23 |
+----+----+
Explanation:
- (20, 20) and (20, 20) are symmetric coordinates because, X1 == Y2 and X2 == Y1. This results in displaying (20, 20) as a distinctive coordinates.
- (20, 21) and (21, 20) are symmetric coordinates because, X1 == Y2 and X2 == Y1. However, only (20, 21) will be displayed because X1 <= Y1.
- (23, 22) and (22, 23) are symmetric coordinates because, X1 == Y2 and X2 == Y1. However, only (22, 23) will be displayed because X1 <= Y1.
The output table is sorted by X and Y in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find unique coordinates (X, Y) from the `Coordinates` table that have a "symmetric partner" (Y, X) also in the table, but we only want to list the coordinate (X, Y) itself if X is less than or equal to Y. The final list should be unique coordinates ordered by X then Y.

We need to find pairs of rows in the _same_ table that are symmetric. This means we'll need to join the `Coordinates` table with itself.

Step 1: Join the `Coordinates` table with itself to find all pairs of coordinates `(X1, Y1)` and `(X2, Y2)` such that `X1 = Y2` and `Y1 = X2`. Let's call the two instances of the table `c1` and `c2`.

```SQL
FROM Coordinates c1
JOIN Coordinates c2 ON c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X;
-- This joins the table to itself where the X and Y values are swapped between the two joined rows.
-- This finds all instances where a symmetric partner exists.
```

Explanation: We use `JOIN` to combine rows from the `Coordinates` table (aliased `c1`) with rows from the _same_ `Coordinates` table (aliased `c2`). The `ON` condition `c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X` finds pairs of rows where the X value of one row matches the Y value of the other, and the Y value of the first matches the X value of the second, which is the definition of symmetric coordinates.

Step 2: The problem asks us to output coordinates `(X1, Y1)` from these symmetric pairs _only if_ `X1 <= Y1`. We can apply this condition to the columns from the `c1` side of our join.

```SQL
SELECT
    c1.X, -- Select X from the first coordinate in the pair
    c1.Y  -- Select Y from the first coordinate in the pair
FROM Coordinates c1
JOIN Coordinates c2 ON c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X
WHERE c1.X <= c1.Y; -- Filter to keep only pairs where the first coordinate satisfies X <= Y
-- This selects the (X, Y) from the first half of each symmetric pair, but only if X <= Y for that coordinate.
```

Explanation: We select `c1.X` and `c1.Y`. The `WHERE c1.X <= c1.Y` clause filters the results of the join. For any symmetric pair `((X1, Y1), (X2, Y2))` where `X1=Y2` and `Y1=X2`:

- If `X1 < Y1`: `c1` could be `(X1, Y1)` or `(Y1, X1)`. If `c1` is `(X1, Y1)`, `c1.X <= c1.Y` (`X1 <= Y1`) is true, so `(X1, Y1)` is included. If `c1` is `(Y1, X1)`, `c1.X <= c1.Y` (`Y1 <= X1`) is false, so `(Y1, X1)` is excluded. Resulting in just `(X1, Y1)`.
- If `X1 = Y1`: `c1` must be `(X1, X1)`. `c1.X <= c1.Y` (`X1 <= X1`) is true, so `(X1, X1)` is included.  
    This effectively filters the joined pairs to yield only the  
    `(X, Y)` coordinate from the pair where `X <= Y`.

Step 3: The result table should contain _unique_ coordinates. The join might produce duplicate rows if there are multiple identical copies of symmetric coordinates in the original table. We use `SELECT DISTINCT` to get only the unique (X, Y) pairs.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    c1.X AS x, -- Alias X to 'x'
    c1.Y AS y  -- Alias Y to 'y'
FROM Coordinates c1
JOIN Coordinates c2 ON c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X
WHERE c1.X <= c1.Y;
-- This ensures that each unique (X, Y) pair satisfying the conditions appears only once. Column names are aliased to match the output.
```

Explanation: We add `DISTINCT` to the `SELECT` clause to remove any duplicate rows from the result. We also alias `c1.X` as `x` and `c1.Y` as `y` to match the required output column names.

Step 4: Finally, the problem requires the result table to be ordered by X and then Y in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    c1.X AS x,
    c1.Y AS y
FROM Coordinates c1
JOIN Coordinates c2 ON c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X
WHERE c1.X <= c1.Y
ORDER BY c1.X ASC, c1.Y ASC;
-- The final result is sorted by X and then by Y in ascending order.
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY c1.X ASC, c1.Y ASC` at the end of the query to sort the final unique results. It sorts first by the X value (ascending) and then by the Y value (ascending) for any rows with the same X value. We can use the aliases `x, y` here instead of `c1.X, c1.Y` if preferred, depending on the specific SQL system.

This query correctly finds symmetric coordinates, filters for the X <= Y condition, ensures uniqueness, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    c1.X AS x,
    c1.Y AS y
FROM Coordinates c1
JOIN Coordinates c2 ON c1.X = c2.Y AND c1.Y = c2.X
WHERE c1.X <= c1.Y
ORDER BY c1.X ASC, c1.Y ASC;
```
