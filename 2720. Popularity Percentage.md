**Description**

Table: `Friends`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user1       | int  |
| user2       | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user1, user2) is the primary key (combination of unique values) of this table.
Each row contains information about friendship where user1 and user2 are friends.
```

Write a solution to find the popularity percentage for  
each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the  
total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of  
users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying  
by 100, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user1` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Friends table:
+-------+-------+
| user1 | user2 |
+-------+-------+
| 2     | 1     |
| 1     | 3     |

| 2     | 6     |
| 7     | 2     |
| 8     | 3     |
| 3     | 9     |
+-------+-------+
Output:
+-------+-----------------------+
| user1 | percentage_popularity |
+-------+-----------------------+
| 1     | 55.56                 |
| 2     | 33.33                 |
| 3     | 33.33                 |
| 4     | 11.11                 |
| 5     | 11.11                 |
| 6     | 22.22                 |
| 7     | 11.11                 |
| 8     | 11.11                 |
| 9     | 11.11                 |
+-------+-----------------------+
Explanation:
There are total 9 users on the platform.
- User "1" has friendships with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 1 would be calculated as (5/9) * 100 = 55.56.
- User "2" has friendships with 1, 6 and 7. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 2 would be calculated as (3/9) * 100 = 33.33.
- User "3" has friendships with 1, 8 and 9. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 3 would be calculated as (3/9) * 100 = 33.33.
- User "4" has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 4 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User "5" has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 5 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User "6" has friendships with 1 and 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 6 would be calculated as (2/9) * 100 = 22.22.
- User "7" has friendships with 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 7 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User "8" has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 8 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
- User "9" has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 9 would be calculated as (1/9) * 100 = 11.11.
user1 is sorted in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to calculate the "popularity percentage" for every user. This is defined as the number of friends a user has divided by the total number of distinct users on the platform, multiplied by 100, and rounded to two decimal places. We need to display the user ID and their calculated percentage, ordered by user ID.

The `Friends` table lists friendships. A friendship between `user1` and `user2` means they are friends with each other. To find the total number of friends for a user, we need to count how many times their ID appears in _either_ the `user1` or `user2` column.

Step 1: Find all unique users on the platform. These are all the distinct IDs present in either the `user1` or `user2` columns of the `Friends` table. We can combine these lists using `UNION` to get unique users.

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS (
    SELECT user1 FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user2 FROM Friends
)
-- This CTE (Common Table Expression) named AllUsers gives us a list of every distinct user ID involved in any friendship.
```

Explanation: We create a temporary result set called `AllUsers`. It contains all the unique values from the `user1` column combined with all the unique values from the `user2` column using `UNION`. This gives us a list of all distinct users present in the friendships table, which represents all users on the platform.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of distinct users found in Step 1. This number will be the denominator in our percentage calculation.

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS (
    SELECT user1 FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user2 FROM Friends
),
TotalUserCount AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count
    FROM AllUsers
)
-- This CTE named TotalUserCount simply counts how many distinct users there are in the AllUsers list.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `TotalUserCount` which counts the rows in the `AllUsers` CTE. This gives us the total number of distinct users on the platform, which is needed for the popularity percentage calculation.

Step 3: Count the number of friends for each user. A user's friends are other users they are listed with in the `Friends` table. To count this easily, we can create a single list of all participations in friendships (listing both sides of each friendship) and then count how many times each user ID appears.

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
TotalUserCount AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FriendshipList AS (
    SELECT user1 AS user_id FROM Friends
    UNION ALL -- Use UNION ALL because we want to list each side of the friendship separately
    SELECT user2 AS user_id FROM Friends
)
-- This CTE named FriendshipList puts all user IDs involved in friendships into one big list.
-- If user A is friends with user B, user A appears once and user B appears once in this list for that friendship.
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE `FriendshipList`. We use `UNION ALL` to combine `user1` and `user2` into a single column `user_id`. Unlike `UNION`, `UNION ALL` includes duplicates, which is exactly what we want here – if user X is in multiple friendships, their ID should appear multiple times so we can count them later.

Step 4: Group the combined list of friendship participations by user ID and count the occurrences. This count is the number of friends for each user.

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
TotalUserCount AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FriendshipList AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS friend_count
    FROM FriendshipList
    GROUP BY user_id
)
-- This CTE named FriendCounts counts how many times each user ID appears in the FriendshipList. This count is the number of friends they have.
```

Explanation: We create a fourth CTE `FriendCounts`. We group the `FriendshipList` by `user_id` and use `COUNT(*)` to find out how many times each distinct user ID appears. This count represents the number of friends each user has.

Step 5: Calculate the popularity percentage for every user listed in `AllUsers` using their friend count from `FriendCounts` and the total user count from `TotalUserCount`. Then format and order the results.

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
TotalUserCount AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FriendshipList AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
FriendCounts AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
SELECT
    au.user1 AS user1, -- Get the user ID from our list of all users
    -- Calculate the percentage: (friend_count / total_user_count) * 100
    -- COALESCE handles users who might have 0 friends (though in this case they would still be in FriendCounts)
    -- Multiply by 100.0 to ensure decimal division
    -- Round to 2 decimal places
    ROUND(CAST(COALESCE(fc.friend_count, 0) AS DECIMAL) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_count FROM TotalUserCount), 2) AS percentage_popularity
FROM AllUsers au -- Start with the list of all possible users
LEFT JOIN FriendCounts fc ON au.user1 = fc.user_id -- Join with friend counts (LEFT JOIN ensures users with 0 friends are included)
ORDER BY au.user1 ASC; -- Order the final result by user ID ascending
```

Explanation:

- We select from the `AllUsers` CTE (aliased `au`) to make sure we calculate the percentage for _every_ user on the platform.
- We `LEFT JOIN` `AllUsers` with `FriendCounts` (aliased `fc`) using the user ID. A `LEFT JOIN` is used to ensure that even if a user somehow ended up in `AllUsers` but not `FriendCounts` (e.g., if the definition of "total users" included users not in `Friends`), they would still be included in the result with a friend count of `NULL`. `COALESCE(fc.friend_count, 0)` converts this `NULL` to `0`.
- The core calculation is `CAST(COALESCE(fc.friend_count, 0) AS DECIMAL) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_count FROM TotalUserCount)`. We cast the friend count to `DECIMAL` and multiply `100` by `.0` (`100.0`) to ensure that the division is performed as floating-point division, giving us a decimal result. We retrieve the `total_count` using a subquery on the `TotalUserCount` CTE.
- `ROUND(..., 2)` rounds the resulting percentage to two decimal places.
- The result column is named `percentage_popularity` as required.
- Finally, `ORDER BY au.user1 ASC` sorts the output rows based on the user ID in ascending order.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH AllUsers AS (
    SELECT user1 FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user2 FROM Friends
),
TotalUserCount AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count
    FROM AllUsers
),
FriendshipList AS (
    SELECT user1 AS user_id FROM Friends
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user2 AS user_id FROM Friends
),
FriendCounts AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS friend_count
    FROM FriendshipList
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT
    au.user1 AS user1,
    ROUND(CAST(COALESCE(fc.friend_count, 0) AS DECIMAL) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_count FROM TotalUserCount), 2) AS percentage_popularity
FROM AllUsers au
LEFT JOIN FriendCounts fc ON au.user1 = fc.user_id
ORDER BY au.user1 ASC;
```
