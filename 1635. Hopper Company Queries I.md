**Description**

Table: `Drivers`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| driver_id   | int     |
| join_date   | date    |
+-------------+---------+
driver_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the driver's ID and the date they joined the Hopper company.
```

Table: `Rides`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| ride_id      | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
| requested_at | date    |
+--------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a ride, the user's ID that requested it, and the day they requested it.
There may be some ride requests in this table that were not accepted.
```

Table: `AcceptedRides`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| ride_id       | int     |
| driver_id     | int     |
| ride_distance | int     |
| ride_duration | int     |
+---------------+---------+
ride_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains some information about an accepted ride.
It is guaranteed that each accepted ride exists in the Rides table.
```

Write a solution to report the following statistics for each month of **2020**:

- The number of drivers currently with the Hopper company by the end of the month (`active_drivers`).
- The number of accepted rides in that month (`accepted_rides`).

Return the result table ordered by `month` in ascending order, where `month` is the month's number (January is `1`, February is `2`, etc.).

The result format is in the following example.

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step for you.

## Problem Summary

We need to generate a monthly report for 2020 showing:

1. The number of active drivers by the end of each month
2. The number of accepted rides in each month  
    The results should be ordered by month (1-12).  
    

Let's build the solution incrementally:

### Step 1: Create a months table to ensure all months of 2020 appear in our report

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
)
SELECT month FROM months;
```

Explanation: First, we create a Common Table Expression (CTE) that generates all 12 months. This ensures our final result includes all months of 2020, even if there are no drivers or rides in some months.

### Step 2: Count active drivers by the end of each month

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
active_drivers_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS active_drivers
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON YEAR(d.join_date) <= 2020
        AND MONTH(d.join_date) <= m.month
        AND (YEAR(d.join_date) < 2020 OR MONTH(d.join_date) <= m.month)
    GROUP BY
        m.month
)
SELECT * FROM active_drivers_by_month;
```

Explanation: Here we join our months CTE with the Drivers table, but we only include drivers who joined by the end of each month in 2020 or earlier. The conditions ensure we count drivers who joined before 2020 as well as those who joined during 2020 up to the current month.

### Step 3: Simplify and correct the active drivers count

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
active_drivers_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS active_drivers
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-31')
    GROUP BY
        m.month
)
SELECT * FROM active_drivers_by_month;
```

Explanation: We simplified the join condition to count all drivers who joined on or before the last day of each month in 2020. We're using string concatenation to create a date for comparison.

### Step 4: Count accepted rides for each month in 2020

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
rides_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(ar.ride_id) AS accepted_rides
    FROM
        Rides r
    LEFT JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    COALESCE(r.accepted_rides, 0) AS accepted_rides
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    rides_by_month r ON m.month = r.month;
```

Explanation: Now we're counting accepted rides for each month in 2020. We join the Rides and AcceptedRides tables, filter for 2020 requests, and group by month. The LEFT JOIN with COALESCE ensures we show 0 for months with no accepted rides.

### Step 5: Combine both queries to create the final solution

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
active_drivers_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS active_drivers
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date <= CAST(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-01') AS DATE) + INTERVAL DAYOFMONTH(LAST_DAY(CONCAT('2020-', m.month, '-01'))) - 1 DAY
    GROUP BY
        m.month
),
accepted_rides_by_month AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(ar.ride_id) AS accepted_rides
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    COALESCE(d.active_drivers, 0) AS active_drivers,
    COALESCE(r.accepted_rides, 0) AS accepted_rides
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    active_drivers_by_month d ON m.month = d.month
LEFT JOIN
    accepted_rides_by_month r ON m.month = r.month
ORDER BY
    m.month;
```

Explanation: This query combines both parts. We create two CTEs - one for active drivers and one for accepted rides. Then we join them with our months CTE to produce the final report with both metrics for each month, ordered by month.

### Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH months AS (
    SELECT 1 AS month
    UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4
    UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8
    UNION SELECT 9 UNION SELECT 10 UNION SELECT 11 UNION SELECT 12
),
active_drivers AS (
    SELECT
        m.month,
        COUNT(d.driver_id) AS active_drivers
    FROM
        months m
    LEFT JOIN
        Drivers d ON d.join_date < DATE_FORMAT(CONCAT('2020-', m.month+1, '-01'), '%Y-%m-%d')
    GROUP BY
        m.month
),
accepted_rides AS (
    SELECT
        MONTH(r.requested_at) AS month,
        COUNT(ar.ride_id) AS accepted_rides
    FROM
        Rides r
    INNER JOIN
        AcceptedRides ar ON r.ride_id = ar.ride_id
    WHERE
        YEAR(r.requested_at) = 2020
    GROUP BY
        MONTH(r.requested_at)
)
SELECT
    m.month,
    COALESCE(ad.active_drivers, 0) AS active_drivers,
    COALESCE(ar.accepted_rides, 0) AS accepted_rides
FROM
    months m
LEFT JOIN
    active_drivers ad ON m.month = ad.month
LEFT JOIN
    accepted_rides ar ON m.month = ar.month
ORDER BY
    m.month;
```

Explanation: This is our complete solution with proper date handling. For active drivers, we count all drivers who joined before the first day of the next month. For accepted rides, we count all rides that were both requested in 2020 and accepted. The results show both metrics for all months of 2020, sorted by month number.
