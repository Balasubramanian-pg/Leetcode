**Description**

Table: `TeamPoints`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| team_id     | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| points      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
team_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team, the name of the country it represents, and the points it has in the global rankings. No two teams will represent the same country.
```

Table: `PointsChange`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| team_id       | int  |
| points_change | int  |
+---------------+------+
team_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table contains the ID of a national team and the change in its points in the global rankings.
points_change can be:
- 0: indicates no change in points.
- positive: indicates an increase in points.
- negative: indicates a decrease in points.
Each team_id that appears in TeamPoints will also appear in this table.
```

The **global ranking** of a national team is its rank after sorting all the teams by their points **in descending order**. If two teams have the same points, we break the tie by sorting them by their name **in lexicographical order**.

The points of each national team should be updated based on its corresponding `points_change` value.

Write a solution to calculate the change in the global rankings after updating each team's points.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
TeamPoints table:
+---------+-------------+--------+
| team_id | name        | points |
+---------+-------------+--------+
| 3       | Algeria     | 1431   |
| 1       | Senegal     | 2132   |
| 2       | New Zealand | 1402   |
| 4       | Croatia     | 1817   |
+---------+-------------+--------+
PointsChange table:
+---------+---------------+
| team_id | points_change |
+---------+---------------+
| 3       | 399           |
| 2       | 0             |
| 4       | 13            |
| 1       | -22           |
+---------+---------------+
Output:
+---------+-------------+-----------+
| team_id | name        | rank_diff |
+---------+-------------+-----------+
| 1       | Senegal     | 0         |
| 4       | Croatia     | -1        |
| 3       | Algeria     | 1         |
| 2       | New Zealand | 0         |
+---------+-------------+-----------+
Explanation:
The global rankings were as follows:
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
| team_id | name        | points | rank |
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
| 1       | Senegal     | 2132   | 1    |
| 4       | Croatia     | 1817   | 2    |
| 3       | Algeria     | 1431   | 3    |
| 2       | New Zealand | 1402   | 4    |
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
After updating the points of each team, the rankings became the following:
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
| team_id | name        | points | rank |
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
| 1       | Senegal     | 2110   | 1    |
| 3       | Algeria     | 1830   | 2    |
| 4       | Croatia     | 1830   | 3    |
| 2       | New Zealand | 1402   | 4    |
+---------+-------------+--------+------+
Since after updating the points Algeria and Croatia have the same points, they are ranked according to their lexicographic order.
Senegal lost 22 points but their rank did not change.
Croatia gained 13 points but their rank decreased by one.
Algeria gained 399 points and their rank increased by one.
New Zealand did not gain or lose points and their rank did not change.
```

## Problem Understanding

The problem involves two tables:

1. **TeamPoints**: Contains team_id, name, and points for national teams
2. **PointsChange**: Contains team_id and points_change values

We need to calculate how each team's global ranking changes after applying the points_change values.

Global ranking rules:

- Teams are ranked by points in descending order
- If two teams have the same points, they're sorted by name in lexicographical order

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let's solve this problem incrementally:

### Step 1: Calculate the original rankings

First, we need to determine each team's original ranking before any points changes:

```SQL
WITH OriginalRanking AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        name,
        points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC, name ASC) AS original_rank
    FROM TeamPoints
)
```

### Step 2: Calculate the new rankings after points changes

Next, we calculate the new rankings after applying the points changes:

```SQL
, NewRanking AS (
    SELECT
        tp.team_id,
        tp.name,
        tp.points + pc.points_change AS new_points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (tp.points + pc.points_change) DESC, tp.name ASC) AS new_rank
    FROM TeamPoints tp
    JOIN PointsChange pc ON tp.team_id = pc.team_id
)
```

### Step 3: Calculate the rank difference

Finally, we calculate the difference between the original and new rankings:

```SQL
SELECT
    nr.team_id,
    nr.name,
    or.original_rank - nr.new_rank AS rank_diff
FROM NewRanking nr
JOIN OriginalRanking or ON nr.team_id = or.team_id
```

## Final Solution

Putting it all together:

```SQL
WITH OriginalRanking AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        name,
        points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC, name ASC) AS original_rank
    FROM TeamPoints
),
NewRanking AS (
    SELECT
        tp.team_id,
        tp.name,
        tp.points + pc.points_change AS new_points,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (tp.points + pc.points_change) DESC, tp.name ASC) AS new_rank
    FROM TeamPoints tp
    JOIN PointsChange pc ON tp.team_id = pc.team_id
)
SELECT
    nr.team_id,
    nr.name,
    or.original_rank - nr.new_rank AS rank_diff
FROM NewRanking nr
JOIN OriginalRanking or ON nr.team_id = or.team_id
```

However, looking at the search results, I see a more elegant solution by directly using ROW_NUMBER() in a single query with a cast to SIGNED integers to calculate the difference:

```SQL
SELECT
    a.team_id,
    a.name,
    CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC, name ASC) AS SIGNED) -
    CAST(ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points + points_change DESC, name ASC) AS SIGNED) AS rank_diff
FROM TeamPoints AS a
JOIN PointsChange AS b ON a.team_id = b.team_id
```

This solution:

1. Calculates the original ranking using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points DESC, name ASC)`
2. Calculates the new ranking using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY points + points_change DESC, name ASC)`
3. Subtracts the new rank from the original rank to get the change in ranking
4. Uses `CAST AS SIGNED` to ensure proper integer subtraction

The result will show:

- Positive values: Team moved up in rankings
- Negative values: Team moved down in rankings
- Zero: Team's ranking didn't change

This is an elegant way to solve the problem with a single query rather than using multiple CTEs.
