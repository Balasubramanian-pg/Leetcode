**Description**

Table: `TeamStats`

```Plain
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| team_id          | int     |
| team_name        | varchar |
| matches_played   | int     |
| wins             | int     |
| draws            | int     |
| losses           | int     |
+------------------+---------+
team_id is the unique key for this table.
This table contains team id, team name, matches_played, wins, draws, and losses.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **points**, **position**, and **tier** for each team in the league. Points are calculated as follows:

- `3` points for a **win**
- `1` point for a **draw**
- `0` points for a **loss**

**Note:** Teams with the same points must be assigned the same position.

**Tier ranking:**

- Divide the league into `3` tiers based on points:
- Tier 1: Top `33%` of teams
- Tier 2: Middle `33%` of teams
- Tier 3: Bottom `34%` of teams
- In case of **ties** at **tier boundaries**, place tied teams in the **higher tier**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `points` _in **descending**, and then by_ `team_name` _in **ascending** order._

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`TeamStats` table:

```Plain
+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
| team_id | team_name         | matches_played | wins | draws | losses |
+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
| 1       | Chelsea           | 22             | 13   | 2     | 7      |
| 2       | Nottingham Forest | 27             | 6    | 6     | 15     |
| 3       | Liverpool         | 17             | 1    | 8     | 8      |
| 4       | Aston Villa       | 20             | 1    | 6     | 13     |
| 5       | Fulham            | 31             | 18   | 1     | 12     |
| 6       | Burnley           | 26             | 6    | 9     | 11     |
| 7       | Newcastle United  | 33             | 11   | 10    | 12     |
| 8       | Sheffield United  | 20             | 18   | 2     | 0      |

+---------+-------------------+----------------+------+-------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------------+--------+----------+---------+
| team_name         | points | position | tier    |
+-------------------+--------+----------+---------+
| Sheffield United  | 56     | 1        | Tier 1  |
| Fulham            | 55     | 2        | Tier 1  |
| Newcastle United  | 43     | 3        | Tier 1  |
| Chelsea           | 41     | 4        | Tier 1  |
| Burnley           | 27     | 5        | Tier 2  |
| Nottingham Forest | 24     | 6        | Tier 2  |
| Everton           | 12     | 7        | Tier 2  |
| Luton Town        | 12     | 7        | Tier 2  |
| Liverpool         | 11     | 9        | Tier 3  |
| Aston Villa       | 9      | 10       | Tier 3  |
+-------------------+--------+----------+---------+
```

**Explanation:**

- Sheffield United has 56 points (18 wins * 3 points + 2 draws * 1 point) and is in position 1.
- Fulham has 55 points (18 wins * 3 points + 1 draw * 1 point) and is in position 2.
- Newcastle United has 43 points (11 wins * 3 points + 10 draws * 1 point) and is in position 3.
- Chelsea has 41 points (13 wins * 3 points + 2 draws * 1 point) and is in position 4.
- Burnley has 27 points (6 wins * 3 points + 9 draws * 1 point) and is in position 5.
- Nottingham Forest has 24 points (6 wins * 3 points + 6 draws * 1 point) and is in position 6.
- Everton and Luton Town both have 12 points, with Everton having 2  
    wins * 3 points + 6 draws * 1 point, and Luton Town having 4 wins * 3  
    points. Both teams share position 7.  
    
- Liverpool has 11 points (1 win * 3 points + 8 draws * 1 point) and is in position 9.
- Aston Villa has 9 points (1 win * 3 points + 6 draws * 1 point) and is in position 10.

**Tier Calculation:**

- **Tier 1:** The top 33% of teams based on points. Sheffield United, Fulham, Newcastle United, and Chelsea fall into Tier 1.
- **Tier 2:** The middle 33% of teams. Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Everton, and Luton Town fall into Tier 2.
- **Tier 3:** The bottom 34% of teams. Liverpool and Aston Villa fall into Tier 3.

## Solutions

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Calculate **points** for each team based on wins, draws, and losses.
2. Assign a **position** (rank) to each team based on their points, handling ties.
3. Assign a **tier** to each team based on their position in the league:
    - **Tier 1**: Top 33% of teams.
    - **Tier 2**: Middle 33% of teams.
    - **Tier 3**: Bottom 34% of teams.
    - In case of ties at tier boundaries, place tied teams in the higher tier.
4. Order the result by points in descending order, then by team name in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Points calculation:
    - **3 points** for a win.
    - **1 point** for a draw.
    - **0 points** for a loss.
- Use the `RANK()` function to handle ties in points.
- Use the `NTILE()` function to assign tiers based on percentile ranking.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Points and Rank**

First, calculate the points for each team and assign a rank based on points.

```SQL
WITH PointsRank AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) AS points,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) DESC) AS position
    FROM
        TeamStats
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**(wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0)**`: Computes the total points for each team.
- `**RANK() OVER (ORDER BY ... DESC)**`: Assigns a rank based on points in descending order. Teams with the same points receive the same rank.
- `**PointsRank**` **CTE**: Stores the calculated points and position for each team.

---

### **Step 3: Assign Tiers**

Next, assign tiers based on the percentile ranking of the teams.

```SQL
, TierAssign AS (
    SELECT
        team_name,
        points,
        position,
        NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY points DESC) AS tier_num
    FROM
        PointsRank
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY points DESC)**`: Divides the teams into 3 tiers based on points.
    - Teams with the highest points are in **Tier 1**.
    - Middle teams are in **Tier 2**.
    - Lowest teams are in **Tier 3**.
- `**TierAssign**` **CTE**: Stores the assigned tier for each team.

---

### **Step 4: Map Tier Numbers to Tier Names**

Finally, map the tier numbers (1, 2, 3) to their respective tier names ("Tier 1", "Tier 2", "Tier 3").

```SQL
SELECT
    team_name,
    points,
    position,
    CASE tier_num
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Tier 1'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Tier 2'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Tier 3'
    END AS tier
FROM
    TierAssign
ORDER BY
    points DESC, team_name ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CASE**` **Statement**: Maps tier numbers to tier names.
- `**ORDER BY points DESC, team_name ASC**`: Orders the result by points in descending order, then by team name in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH PointsRank AS (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        team_name,
        (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) AS points,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) + (losses * 0) DESC) AS position
    FROM
        TeamStats
),
TierAssign AS (
    SELECT
        team_name,
        points,
        position,
        NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY points DESC) AS tier_num
    FROM
        PointsRank
)
SELECT
    team_name,
    points,
    position,
    CASE tier_num
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Tier 1'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Tier 2'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Tier 3'
    END AS tier
FROM
    TierAssign
ORDER BY
    points DESC, team_name ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Points Calculation**: Computes the total points for each team.
3. **Ranking**: Assigns a rank based on points, handling ties appropriately.
4. **Tier Assignment**: Divides teams into tiers based on percentile ranking.
5. **Tier Mapping**: Maps tier numbers to tier names.
6. **Ordering**: Ensures the result is ordered correctly.

This query returns the desired output, listing each team’s points, position, and tier in the league, ordered by points and team name.
