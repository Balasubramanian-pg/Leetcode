Table: `Users`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| user_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.
```

Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+
```

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to modify the names in the `Users` table so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase. The solution involves using SQL string functions to manipulate the names accordingly.

### Approach

1. **String Manipulation**: We will use SQL functions to capitalize the first letter of each name and make the rest of the letters lowercase.
2. **Update Names**: For each row in the `Users` table, we apply these transformations to the `name` column.
3. **Order Results**: Finally, we order the result by `user_id` as required by the problem statement.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT
    user_id,
    CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id;
```

### Explanation

- **LEFT(name, 1)**: This function extracts the first character of the name.
- **UPPER()**: Converts the first character to uppercase.
- **SUBSTRING(name, 2)**: This function extracts the substring starting from the second character to the end of the name.
- **LOWER()**: Converts the rest of the characters to lowercase.
- **CONCAT()**: Concatenates the uppercase first character with the rest of the name in lowercase.
- **ORDER BY user_id**: Ensures the result is ordered by `user_id` in ascending order.

This approach efficiently corrects the names as required, ensuring that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase, and returns the results in the specified order.
