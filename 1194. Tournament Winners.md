**Description**

Table: `Players`

```Plain
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
```

Table: `Matches`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     |
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belong to the same group.
```

The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, the **lowest** `player_id` wins.

Write a solution to find the winner in each group.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Players table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |

| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
| 35        | 2          |
| 50        | 2          |
| 20        | 3          |
| 40        | 3          |
+-----------+------------+
Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | first_player | second_player | first_score | second_score |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 15           | 45            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 25            | 1           | 2            |
| 3          | 30           | 15            | 2           | 0            |
| 4          | 40           | 20            | 5           | 2            |
| 5          | 35           | 50            | 1           | 1            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
Output:
+-----------+------------+
| group_id  | player_id  |
+-----------+------------+
| 1         | 15         |
| 2         | 35         |
| 3         | 40         |
+-----------+------------+
```

## Solutions

Now I need to solve a SQL problem that involves calculating scores and finding winners across different groups. Let me break this down step by step.

## Problem Understanding

We have two tables:

1. `Players` - Contains player_id and group_id
2. `Matches` - Contains match details with first_player, second_player and their respective scores

The goal is to find the player with the highest total score in each group. If there's a tie, the player with the lowest player_id wins.

## Solution Approach

To solve this problem, I need to:

1. Calculate the total score for each player from all their matches
2. Group players by their group_id
3. Find the player with the highest score in each group
4. Break ties by selecting the player with the lowest player_id

The challenge is that a player can appear either as first_player or second_player in the Matches table, so I need to account for both cases.

## SQL Solution

```SQL
WITH PlayerScores AS (
    SELECT
        p.player_id,
        p.group_id,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN m.first_player = p.player_id THEN m.first_score
                WHEN m.second_player = p.player_id THEN m.second_score
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) AS total_score
    FROM
        Players p
    LEFT JOIN
        Matches m ON p.player_id = m.first_player OR p.player_id = m.second_player
    GROUP BY
        p.player_id, p.group_id
)

SELECT
    group_id,
    player_id
FROM (
    SELECT
        group_id,
        player_id,
        total_score,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY total_score DESC, player_id ASC) as player_rank
    FROM
        PlayerScores
) RankedPlayers
WHERE
    player_rank = 1;
```

## Explanation

The solution uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `PlayerScores` to calculate each player's total score:

1. **Calculate Total Scores**:
    - Join the Players table with the Matches table where the player appears as either first_player or second_player
    - Use a CASE statement to sum up the player's scores from all matches
    - Group by player_id and group_id to get the total score for each player
2. **Rank Players**:
    - In the main query, use a window function RANK() to rank players within each group
    - PARTITION BY group_id ensures rankings are calculated separately for each group
    - ORDER BY total_score DESC ranks players with higher scores first
    - The secondary ORDER BY player_id ASC ensures that in case of a tie, the player with the lowest ID ranks higher
3. **Select Winners**:
    - The outer query filters for only the top-ranked player in each group (player_rank = 1)
    - This gives us the winner for each group

The RANK() function is perfect here because it handles the tie-breaking logic elegantly. The combination of ordering by score descending and then player_id ascending ensures that for tied scores, the player with the lowest ID will be ranked first.

This solution efficiently handles the requirements of finding the player with the highest total score in each group, with the specified tie-breaking rule.
