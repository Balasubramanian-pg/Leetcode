**Description**

Table: `Purchases`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| purchase_id   | int  |
| user_id       | int  |
| purchase_date | date |
+---------------+------+
purchase_id contains unique values.
This table contains logs of the dates that users purchased from a certain retailer.
```

Write a solution to report the IDs of the users that made any two purchases **at most** `7` days apart.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Purchases table:
+-------------+---------+---------------+
| purchase_id | user_id | purchase_date |
+-------------+---------+---------------+
| 4           | 2       | 2022-03-13    |
| 1           | 5       | 2022-02-11    |
| 3           | 7       | 2022-06-19    |
| 6           | 2       | 2022-03-20    |
| 5           | 7       | 2022-06-19    |
| 2           | 2       | 2022-06-08    |
+-------------+---------+---------------+
Output:
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 2       |
| 7       |
+---------+
Explanation:
User 2 had two purchases on 2022-03-13 and 2022-03-20. Since the second purchase is within 7 days of the first purchase, we add their ID.
User 5 had only 1 purchase.
User 7 had two purchases on the same day so we add their ID.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step for you.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to find users who have made any two purchases that are at most 7 days apart. This means we need to:

1. Find all pairs of purchases for each user
2. Calculate the date difference between each pair
3. Select users who have at least one pair with a date difference â‰¤ 7 days
4. Order the results by user_id

## Step 1: Start with basic query structure

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM Purchases
```

Explanation: We begin with a simple query that selects distinct user IDs from the Purchases table. This is our starting point.

## Step 2: Self-join to compare purchases

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
```

Explanation: We perform a self-join on the Purchases table to compare each purchase with other purchases by the same user. This creates pairs of purchases for each user.

## Step 3: Add condition to avoid comparing a purchase with itself

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id <> p2.purchase_id
```

Explanation: We add a condition to ensure we don't compare a purchase with itself by checking that the purchase IDs are different.

## Step 4: Calculate date difference and filter

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id <> p2.purchase_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 7
```

Explanation: We use the DATEDIFF function to calculate the number of days between two purchase dates. We filter for pairs where the difference is between 0 and 7 days.

## Step 5: Wait - we need to consider the absolute difference

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id <> p2.purchase_id
WHERE ABS(DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date)) BETWEEN 0 AND 7
```

Explanation: Since we don't know which purchase came first, we use the absolute value of the date difference to ensure we catch all pairs that are at most 7 days apart.

## Step 6: Avoid duplicate pairs (p1,p2) and (p2,p1)

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id < p2.purchase_id
WHERE ABS(DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date)) BETWEEN 0 AND 7
```

Explanation: To avoid counting the same pair of purchases twice, we use `p1.purchase_id < p2.purchase_id` instead of `p1.purchase_id <> p2.purchase_id`. This ensures each pair is considered only once.

## Step 7: Add the ORDER BY clause

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id < p2.purchase_id
WHERE ABS(DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date)) BETWEEN 0 AND 7
ORDER BY p1.user_id
```

Explanation: We add the ORDER BY clause to sort the results by user_id as required.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases p1
JOIN Purchases p2
ON p1.user_id = p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id < p2.purchase_id
WHERE ABS(DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date)) <= 7
ORDER BY p1.user_id
```

Explanation: This final solution:

1. Performs a self-join to create pairs of purchases for each user
2. Uses `p1.purchase_id < p2.purchase_id` to ensure each pair is considered only once
3. Filters for pairs where the absolute date difference is at most 7 days
4. Selects distinct user IDs to avoid duplicates
5. Orders the results by user_id

Note: I changed the BETWEEN 0 AND 7 to <= 7 for simplicity, but both are equivalent.
