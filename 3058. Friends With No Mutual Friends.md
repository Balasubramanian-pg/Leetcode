**Description**

Table: `Friends`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id1    | int  |
| user_id2    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id1, user_id2) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains user id1, user id2, both of whom are friends with each other.
```

Write a solution to find **all pairs** of users who are friends with each other and have **no mutual** friends.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `user_id1,` `user_id2` _in **ascending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Friends table:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 6        | 7        |
| 3        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 8        | 9        |
+----------+----------+
Output:
+----------+----------+
| user_id1 | user_id2 |
+----------+----------+
| 6        | 7        |
| 8        | 9        |
+----------+----------+
Explanation:
- Users 1 and 2 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 5, so this pair is not included.
- Users 2 and 3 are friends, they both share a mutual friend with user ID 4, resulting in exclusion, similarly for users 2 and 4 who share a mutual friend with user ID 3, hence not included.
- Users 1 and 5 are friends with each other, but they share a mutual friend with user ID 2, so this pair is not included.
- Users 6 and 7, as well as users 8 and 9, are friends with each other, and they don't have any mutual friends, hence included.
- Users 3 and 4 are friends with each other, but their mutual connection with user ID 2 means they are not included, similarly for users 2 and 5 are friends but are excluded due to their mutual connection with user ID 1.
Output table is ordered by user_id1 in ascending order.
```

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Identify all direct friendships.
2. For each friendship, check if there are any **mutual friends** (i.e., users who are friends with both).
3. Exclude those with mutual friends.
4. Return the list ordered by `user_id1`, `user_id2`.

### **Step-by-step Breakdown**

### **Step 1: Normalize the Friendship Pairs**

Friendship is bidirectional, but each pair is stored only once. For accurate comparison, ensure user_id1 < user_id2 in all cases.

```SQL
WITH NormalizedFriends AS (
    SELECT
        LEAST(user_id1, user_id2) AS user_id1,
        GREATEST(user_id1, user_id2) AS user_id2
    FROM Friends
)
```

---

### **Step 2: Build Adjacency List**

Build a list of all friends per user to later identify mutual friends.

```SQL
, AllConnections AS (
    SELECT user_id1 AS user_id, user_id2 AS friend FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user_id2 AS user_id, user_id1 AS friend FROM Friends
)
```

---

### **Step 3: Find All Mutual Friends**

For every friendship (u1, u2), check if there exists a third user who is a friend of **both**.

```SQL
, Mutuals AS (
    SELECT
        LEAST(a.user_id, b.user_id) AS user_id1,
        GREATEST(a.user_id, b.user_id) AS user_id2,
        a.friend AS mutual_friend
    FROM AllConnections a
    JOIN AllConnections b
        ON a.friend = b.friend
        AND a.user_id < b.user_id
)
```

---

### **Step 4: Get Friend Pairs With Mutual Friends**

Get the distinct (user_id1, user_id2) pairs from the Mutuals list.

```SQL
, HasMutualFriend AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id1, user_id2
    FROM Mutuals
)
```

---

### **Step 5: Subtract to Get Required Output**

Now filter `NormalizedFriends` where no mutual friends exist.

```SQL
SELECT nf.user_id1, nf.user_id2
FROM NormalizedFriends nf
LEFT JOIN HasMutualFriend hmf
    ON nf.user_id1 = hmf.user_id1 AND nf.user_id2 = hmf.user_id2
WHERE hmf.user_id1 IS NULL
ORDER BY nf.user_id1, nf.user_id2;
```

---

### **Final Query**

```SQL
WITH NormalizedFriends AS (
    SELECT
        LEAST(user_id1, user_id2) AS user_id1,
        GREATEST(user_id1, user_id2) AS user_id2
    FROM Friends
),
AllConnections AS (
    SELECT user_id1 AS user_id, user_id2 AS friend FROM Friends
    UNION
    SELECT user_id2 AS user_id, user_id1 AS friend FROM Friends
),
Mutuals AS (
    SELECT
        LEAST(a.user_id, b.user_id) AS user_id1,
        GREATEST(a.user_id, b.user_id) AS user_id2,
        a.friend AS mutual_friend
    FROM AllConnections a
    JOIN AllConnections b
        ON a.friend = b.friend
        AND a.user_id < b.user_id
),
HasMutualFriend AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id1, user_id2
    FROM Mutuals
)
SELECT nf.user_id1, nf.user_id2
FROM NormalizedFriends nf
LEFT JOIN HasMutualFriend hmf
    ON nf.user_id1 = hmf.user_id1 AND nf.user_id2 = hmf.user_id2
WHERE hmf.user_id1 IS NULL
ORDER BY nf.user_id1, nf.user_id2;
```

This query is robust, logically sound, and designed for clarity and scalability. Would you like this adapted for a very large dataset using index hints or performance tuning?
