### **Description**

Table: `Books`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| book_id        | int     |
| name           | varchar |
| available_from | date    |
+----------------+---------+
book_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| order_id       | int     |
| book_id        | int     |
| quantity       | int     |
| dispatch_date  | date    |
+----------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
book_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Books table.
```

Write a solution to report the **books** that have sold **less than** `10` copies in the last year, excluding books that have been available for less than one month from today. **Assume today is** `2019-06-23`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Books table:
+---------+--------------------+----------------+
| book_id | name               | available_from |
+---------+--------------------+----------------+
| 1       | "Kalila And Demna" | 2010-01-01     |
| 2       | "28 Letters"       | 2012-05-12     |
| 3       | "The Hobbit"       | 2019-06-10     |
| 4       | "13 Reasons Why"   | 2019-06-01     |
| 5       | "The Hunger Games" | 2008-09-21     |
+---------+--------------------+----------------+
Orders table:
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+
| order_id | book_id | quantity | dispatch_date |
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 1       | 2        | 2018-07-26    |
| 2        | 1       | 1        | 2018-11-05    |
| 3        | 3       | 8        | 2019-06-11    |
| 4        | 4       | 6        | 2019-06-05    |
| 5        | 4       | 5        | 2019-06-20    |
| 6        | 5       | 9        | 2009-02-02    |
| 7        | 5       | 8        | 2010-04-13    |
+----------+---------+----------+---------------+
Output:
+-----------+--------------------+
| book_id   | name               |
+-----------+--------------------+
| 1         | "Kalila And Demna" |
| 2         | "28 Letters"       |
| 5         | "The Hunger Games" |
+-----------+--------------------+
```

### **Solutions**

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT book_id, name
FROM
    Books
    LEFT JOIN Orders USING (book_id)
WHERE available_from < '2019-05-23'GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(IF(dispatch_date >= '2018-06-23', quantity, 0)) < 10;
```

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step.

First, let's understand what we need to find:

- Books that sold less than 10 copies in the last year (from 2018-06-23 to 2019-06-23)
- Excluding books available for less than one month (available after 2019-05-23)

Let me write a solution:

```SQL
SELECT b.book_id, b.name
FROM Books b
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON b.book_id = o.book_id AND o.dispatch_date BETWEEN '2018-06-23' AND '2019-06-23'
WHERE b.available_from < '2019-05-23'
GROUP BY b.book_id, b.name
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(o.quantity), 0) < 10;
```

Let's analyze why this works:

1. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures we include all books, even those with no orders.
2. The condition `o.dispatch_date BETWEEN '2018-06-23' AND '2019-06-23'` filters orders to only those from the last year.
3. The `WHERE` clause excludes books available for less than a month (available after 2019-05-23).
4. The `GROUP BY` groups the results by book.
5. The `HAVING` clause filters for books with less than 10 copies sold in the last year. The `COALESCE` handles books with no orders by treating them as 0.

Checking the example data:

- Book 1 ("Kalila And Demna"): Total quantity sold in last year = 3 (2+1) → Included
- Book 2 ("28 Letters"): No orders in the last year (0) → Included
- Book 3 ("The Hobbit"): Available from 2019-06-10, less than a month ago → Excluded
- Book 4 ("13 Reasons Why"): Total quantity sold in last year = 11 (6+5) → Excluded
- Book 5 ("The Hunger Games"): No orders in the last year (0) → Included

  

# Understanding COALESCE in the Books Query

The `COALESCE` function is crucial in this query, and I'll explain why it makes a difference in your results.

## Why COALESCE is Needed

When you use a LEFT JOIN and there are no matching records:

- The columns from the right table (Orders) will be NULL
- SUM() of NULL values returns NULL (not zero)

### Without COALESCE:

```SQL
HAVING SUM(o.quantity) < 10
```

- Books with no orders will have NULL for the sum
- NULL < 10 evaluates to UNKNOWN (not TRUE)
- These books get filtered out

### With COALESCE:

```SQL
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(o.quantity), 0) < 10
```

- Converts NULL to 0
- 0 < 10 evaluates to TRUE
- Books with no orders are included

## Why You Get Different Result Counts

1. **With COALESCE (3 books)**:
    - Book 1: 3 sold (2+1) → included
    - Book 2: NULL (no orders) → becomes 0 → included
    - Book 5: NULL (orders outside date range) → becomes 0 → included
2. **Without COALESCE (1 book)**:
    - Book 1: 3 sold → included
    - Book 2: NULL → excluded
    - Book 5: NULL → excluded

## The Correct Approach

Your query with COALESCE is correct because:

1. It properly handles books with no sales
2. Matches the problem requirement to include books that sold less than 10 copies
3. "Less than 10" should include zero sales (which appear as NULL after LEFT JOIN)

## Alternative Solution

You could also write it this way (equivalent logic):

```SQL
HAVING SUM(o.quantity) < 10 OR SUM(o.quantity) IS NULL
```

But COALESCE is generally cleaner for this case.

  

Here are the SQL commands to create and populate the `Books` and `Orders` tables with the example data:

```SQL
-- Create Books table
CREATE TABLE Books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    available_from DATE
);

-- Create Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    dispatch_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);

-- Insert data into Books table
INSERT INTO Books (book_id, name, available_from) VALUES
(1, 'Kalila And Demna', '2010-01-01'),
(2, '28 Letters', '2012-05-12'),
(3, 'The Hobbit', '2019-06-10'),
(4, '13 Reasons Why', '2019-06-01'),
(5, 'The Hunger Games', '2008-09-21');

-- Insert data into Orders table
INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, book_id, quantity, dispatch_date) VALUES
(1, 1, 2, '2018-07-26'),
(2, 1, 1, '2018-11-05'),
(3, 3, 8, '2019-06-11'),
(4, 4, 6, '2019-06-05'),
(5, 4, 5, '2019-06-20'),
(6, 5, 9, '2009-02-02'),
(7, 5, 8, '2010-04-13');
```

And here's the solution query to find books that sold less than 10 copies in the last year (from 2018-06-23 to 2019-06-23) and have been available for at least 1 month (since before 2019-05-23):

```SQL
SELECT b.book_id, b.name
FROM Books b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT book_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold
    FROM Orders
    WHERE dispatch_date BETWEEN '2018-06-23' AND '2019-06-23'
    GROUP BY book_id
) o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
WHERE
    (o.total_sold < 10 OR o.total_sold IS NULL)
    AND b.available_from <= '2019-05-23'
ORDER BY b.book_id;
```

Key points about the solution:

1. Uses a LEFT JOIN to include books with no orders
2. Filters for books available for at least 1 month (before 2019-05-23)
3. Checks for books with less than 10 sales or no sales in the last year
4. The result matches the example output, excluding books 3 and 4 which were either recently available or sold enough copies
