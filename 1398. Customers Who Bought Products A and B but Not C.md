**Description**

Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| customer_id         | int     |
| customer_name       | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
customer_id is the column with unique values for this table.
customer_name is the name of the customer.
```

Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| customer_id   | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the column with unique values for this table.
customer_id is the id of the customer who bought the product "product_name".
```

Write a solution to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products **"A"**, **"B"** but did not buy the product **"C"** since we want to recommend them to purchase this product.

Return the result table **ordered** by `customer_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Diana         |
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
| 4           | Jhon          |
+-------------+---------------+
Orders table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| order_id   | customer_id  | product_name  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         |     1        |     A         |
| 20         |     1        |     B         |
| 30         |     1        |     D         |
| 40         |     1        |     C         |
| 50         |     2        |     A         |
| 60         |     3        |     A         |
| 70         |     3        |     B         |
| 80         |     3        |     D         |
| 90         |     4        |     C         |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
Output:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: Only the customer_id with id 3 bought the product A and B but not the product C.
```

I'll write a SQL solution to find customers who bought products A and B but not C, ordered by customer_id.

Looking at the problem:

1. We need to identify customers who bought both products A and B
2. These customers must not have bought product C
3. Results should be ordered by customer_id

Here's the SQL solution:

```SQL
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    -- Customers who bought product A
    SELECT customer_id FROM Orders WHERE product_name = 'A'
)
AND c.customer_id IN (
    -- Customers who bought product B
    SELECT customer_id FROM Orders WHERE product_name = 'B'
)
AND c.customer_id NOT IN (
    -- Customers who bought product C
    SELECT customer_id FROM Orders WHERE product_name = 'C'
)
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

This query:

1. Selects from the Customers table
2. Uses three subqueries with IN/NOT IN clauses:
    - First IN clause finds customers who bought product A
    - Second IN clause finds customers who bought product B
    - NOT IN clause excludes customers who bought product C
3. Orders the results by customer_id as required

Looking at the example data, customer with ID 3 (Elizabeth) is the only one who bought both A and B but not C, which matches the expected output.

Alternative solution using JOIN and GROUP BY:

```SQL
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING
    SUM(CASE WHEN o.product_name = 'A' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
    AND SUM(CASE WHEN o.product_name = 'B' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
    AND SUM(CASE WHEN o.product_name = 'C' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

This approach:

1. Joins the Customers and Orders tables
2. Groups by customer_id and customer_name
3. Uses HAVING with aggregate functions to ensure:
    - At least one product A was purchased
    - At least one product B was purchased
    - Zero product C was purchased
4. Orders by customer_id

Both solutions will produce the correct result.
