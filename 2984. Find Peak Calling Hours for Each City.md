**Description**

Table: `Calls`

```Plain
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| caller_id    | int      |
| recipient_id | int      |
| call_time    | datetime |
| city         | varchar  |
+--------------+----------+
(caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains caller id, recipient id, call time, and city.
```

Write a solution to find the **peak** calling **hour** for each `city`. If **multiple hours** have the **same** number of calls, all of those hours will be recognized as **peak hours** for that specific city.

Return _the result table ordered by **peak calling hour** and_ `city` _in **descending** order._

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Calls table:
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           | city     |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 22:46:07 | Houston  |
| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 22:57:13 | Houston  |
| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 21:28:44 | Houston  |
| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 22:04:15 | Houston  |
| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 | New York |
| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 14:22:22 | New York |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+----------+
Output:
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
| city     | peak_calling_hour | number_of_calls |
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
| Houston  | 22                | 3               |
| New York | 14                | 1               |
| New York | 13                | 1               |
+----------+-------------------+-----------------+
Explanation:
For Houston:
  - The peak time is 22:00, with a total of 3 calls recorded.
For New York:
  - Both 13:00 and 14:00 hours have equal call counts of 1, so both times are considered peak hours.
Output table is ordered by peak_calling_hour and city in descending order.
```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to find, for each city, which hour(s) had the most calls. If there's a tie for the highest number of calls in a city, we need to list all the tying hours. The final result should be ordered by peak calling hour descending, and then by city descending.

We will work with the `Calls` table. We need to extract the hour from the `call_time` and count calls for each hour within each city.

Step 1: From the `Calls` table, we need to get the city and extract the hour from the `call_time`. We can use a function like `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time)` to get the hour as an integer (0-23).

```SQL
SELECT
    city,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time) AS call_hour
FROM Calls;
-- This extracts the city and the hour (0-23) for every call.
```

Explanation: We select the `city` column and use `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time)` to get just the hour part of the `call_time` timestamp. We name this extracted hour `call_hour`.

Step 2: Now, we need to count the number of calls for each combination of `city` and `call_hour`. We achieve this by grouping the results from Step 1 by `city` and the calculated `call_hour`, and then using `COUNT(*)`.

```SQL
WITH HourlyCallCounts AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time) AS call_hour,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_calls
    FROM Calls
    GROUP BY city, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time)
)
-- This CTE (Common Table Expression) counts the total number of calls for each specific hour within each city.
```

Explanation: We create a CTE called `HourlyCallCounts`. We group the rows from the `Calls` table by `city` and the hour extracted from `call_time`. `COUNT(*)` counts the number of rows (calls) within each group. This gives us the total call volume for every hour of the day, for every city.

Step 3: For each city, we need to identify the hour(s) that have the _maximum_ number of calls. We can use a window function like `DENSE_RANK()` over the `HourlyCallCounts` CTE. We partition by `city` (so the ranking is done independently for each city) and order by `number_of_calls` descending (so the highest counts get rank 1). `DENSE_RANK()` is used because if multiple hours in a city have the same highest count, they should all get rank 1.

```SQL
WITH HourlyCallCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
RankedHourlyCounts AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        call_hour,
        number_of_calls,
        -- Rank the hours within each city by the number of calls, highest count gets rank 1
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY number_of_calls DESC) as rnk
    FROM HourlyCallCounts
)
-- This CTE ranks the hours within each city based on their call volume. Rank 1 is the peak hour(s).
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `RankedHourlyCounts` from `HourlyCallCounts`. We add a new column `rnk` using `DENSE_RANK()`.

- `PARTITION BY city`: The ranking is calculated separately for each city.
- `ORDER BY number_of_calls DESC`: Within each city, hours are ordered by their call count from highest to lowest.
- `DENSE_RANK()`: Assigns a rank. The hour(s) with the highest call count in a city get rank 1. If multiple hours have the same highest count, they all get rank 1.

Step 4: Now that we have the rank, we simply need to select the rows where the rank (`rnk`) is 1. These are the hours with the maximum call count for each city.

```SQL
WITH HourlyCallCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
RankedHourlyCounts AS ( ... ) -- from step 3
SELECT
    city,
    call_hour AS peak_calling_hour, -- Alias the hour column
    number_of_calls
FROM RankedHourlyCounts
WHERE rnk = 1; -- Filter to keep only the rows with rank 1 (the peak hours)
-- This filters the ranked results to show only the peak hour(s) for each city.
```

Explanation: We select `city`, `call_hour` (aliased as `peak_calling_hour`), and `number_of_calls` from the `RankedHourlyCounts` CTE. The `WHERE rnk = 1` clause filters the results to only include those rows that were ranked 1 within their city, meaning they represent an hour (or hours) with the highest call count for that city.

Step 5: Finally, the result table must be ordered by `peak_calling_hour` descending and then by `city` descending.

```SQL
WITH HourlyCallCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
RankedHourlyCounts AS ( ... ) -- from step 3
SELECT
    city,
    call_hour AS peak_calling_hour,
    number_of_calls
FROM RankedHourlyCounts
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY peak_calling_hour DESC, city DESC; -- Apply the final ordering
```

Explanation: We add `ORDER BY peak_calling_hour DESC, city DESC` at the end of the query to sort the final results. It sorts first by the `peak_calling_hour` from largest to smallest, and then for any rows with the same peak hour, it sorts by `city` from Z to A.

This query correctly identifies the peak calling hour(s) for each city, handles ties, and orders the output as required.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH HourlyCallCounts AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time) AS call_hour,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_calls
    FROM Calls
    GROUP BY city, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM call_time)
),
RankedHourlyCounts AS (
    SELECT
        city,
        call_hour,
        number_of_calls,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY number_of_calls DESC) as rnk
    FROM HourlyCallCounts
)
SELECT
    city,
    call_hour AS peak_calling_hour,
    number_of_calls
FROM RankedHourlyCounts
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY peak_calling_hour DESC, city DESC;
```
