**Description**

Table: `Problems`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| problem_id  | int  |
| likes       | int  |
| dislikes    | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, problem_id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the number of likes and dislikes for a LeetCode problem.
```

Find the IDs of the **low-quality** problems. A LeetCode problem is **low-quality** if the like percentage of the problem (number of likes divided by the total number of votes) is **strictly less than** `60%`.

Return the result table ordered by `problem_id` in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Problems table:
+------------+-------+----------+
| problem_id | likes | dislikes |
+------------+-------+----------+
| 6          | 1290  | 425      |
| 11         | 2677  | 8659     |
| 1          | 4446  | 2760     |
| 7          | 8569  | 6086     |
| 13         | 2050  | 4164     |
| 10         | 9002  | 7446     |
+------------+-------+----------+
Output:
+------------+
| problem_id |
+------------+
| 7          |
| 10         |
| 11         |
| 13         |
+------------+
Explanation: The like percentages are as follows:
- Problem 1: (4446 / (4446 + 2760)) * 100 = 61.69858%
- Problem 6: (1290 / (1290 + 425)) * 100 = 75.21866%
- Problem 7: (8569 / (8569 + 6086)) * 100 = 58.47151%
- Problem 10: (9002 / (9002 + 7446)) * 100 = 54.73006%
- Problem 11: (2677 / (2677 + 8659)) * 100 = 23.61503%
- Problem 13: (2050 / (2050 + 4164)) * 100 = 32.99002%
Problems 7, 10, 11, and 13 are low-quality problems because their like percentages are less than 60%.
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step-by-step.

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks us to:

1. Calculate the like percentage for each problem (likes divided by total votes)
2. Find problems where this percentage is less than 60%
3. Return the problem IDs in ascending order

Let's break down the solution.

## Step 1: Calculate the like percentage for each problem

```SQL
SELECT
    problem_id,
    likes,
    dislikes,
    (likes * 100.0) / (likes + dislikes) AS like_percentage
FROM Problems
```

Explanation: We calculate the like percentage by dividing the number of likes by the total votes (likes + dislikes) and multiplying by 100. The `100.0` with a decimal point ensures we get floating-point division instead of integer division.

## Step 2: Filter for low-quality problems (like percentage < 60%)

```SQL
SELECT
    problem_id,
    (likes * 100.0) / (likes + dislikes) AS like_percentage
FROM Problems
WHERE (likes * 100.0) / (likes + dislikes) < 60
```

Explanation: We add a WHERE clause to filter for problems with a like percentage less than 60%.

## Step 3: Format the output as required

```SQL
SELECT problem_id
FROM Problems
WHERE (likes * 100.0) / (likes + dislikes) < 60
ORDER BY problem_id ASC
```

Explanation: We simplify the output to only include the problem_id column and add an ORDER BY clause to sort the results in ascending order.

## Final Solution:

```SQL
SELECT problem_id
FROM Problems
WHERE (likes * 100.0) / (likes + dislikes) < 60
ORDER BY problem_id
```

This query works by:

1. Calculating the like percentage for each problem
2. Filtering for problems with a like percentage less than 60%
3. Returning the problem IDs in ascending order

For the example data, this returns:

- Problem 7: 58.47% like percentage
- Problem 10: 54.73% like percentage
- Problem 11: 23.62% like percentage
- Problem 13: 32.99% like percentage

All these problems have like percentages below 60%, making them "low-quality" according to the problem's definition.
