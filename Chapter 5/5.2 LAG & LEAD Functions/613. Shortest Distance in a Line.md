**Description**

Table: `Point`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
+-------------+------+
In SQL, x is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the position of a point on the X-axis.
```

Find the shortest distance between any two points from the `Point` table.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Point table:
+----+
| x  |
+----+
| -1 |
| 0  |
| 2  |
+----+
Output:
+----------+
| shortest |
+----------+
| 1        |
+----------+
Explanation: The shortest distance is between points -1 and 0 which is |(-1) - 0| = 1.
```

**Solutions**

### Understanding the LeetCode SQL Problem: Finding the Shortest Distance Between Points

This problem asks us to find the minimum distance between any two points in a one-dimensional space (the X-axis). Let me break down the problem, explain the approaches, and provide multiple solutions.

## Problem Analysis

We have a table called `Point` with a single column `x` that represents positions on the X-axis. We need to find the shortest distance between any two distinct points.

The distance between two points on a number line is simply the absolute difference between their coordinates: |x₁ - x₂|.

## Solution Approaches

### 1. Self-Join Approach

The most straightforward approach is to join the table with itself to create all possible pairs of points, calculate their distances, and find the minimum.

```SQL
SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM Point p1
CROSS JOIN Point p2
WHERE p1.x != p2.x;
```

However, this creates duplicate pairs - for example, distance(1,3) and distance(3,1) are the same. We can optimize by ensuring we only compare each pair once:

```SQL
SELECT MIN(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM Point p1
JOIN Point p2 ON p1.x < p2.x;
```

### 2. Window Function Approach (Adjacent Points)

When points are sorted, the minimum distance must occur between adjacent points. We can use window functions to compare adjacent points:

```SQL
SELECT MIN(x - prev_x) AS shortest
FROM (
    SELECT x, LAG(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) AS prev_x
    FROM Point
) AS sorted_points
WHERE prev_x IS NOT NULL;
```

Alternatively, using LEAD instead of LAG:

```SQL
SELECT MIN(next_x - x) AS shortest
FROM (
    SELECT x, LEAD(x) OVER (ORDER BY x) AS next_x
    FROM Point
) AS sorted_points
WHERE next_x IS NOT NULL;
```

### 3. Difference with LIMIT Approach

If we order the differences, the shortest will be first:

```SQL
SELECT ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS shortest
FROM Point p1
JOIN Point p2 ON p1.x < p2.x
ORDER BY shortest
LIMIT 1;
```

### 4. Subquery Approach

Another way is to use a subquery to calculate all distances:

```SQL
SELECT MIN(distance) AS shortest
FROM (
    SELECT ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS distance
    FROM Point p1
    JOIN Point p2 ON p1.x != p2.x
) AS distances;
```

### 5. CTE Approach

Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) for better readability:

```SQL
WITH PointPairs AS (
    SELECT p1.x AS x1, p2.x AS x2, ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS distance
    FROM Point p1
    JOIN Point p2 ON p1.x < p2.x
)
SELECT MIN(distance) AS shortest
FROM PointPairs;
```

## Optimization for Sorted Points (Follow-up Question)

If the points are already sorted in ascending order, the minimum distance must be between adjacent points. This allows for a significant optimization:

### 1. Optimized Window Function

```SQL
SELECT MIN(x - prev_x) AS shortest
FROM (
    SELECT x, LAG(x) OVER () AS prev_x
    FROM Point
    ORDER BY x
) AS sorted_points
WHERE prev_x IS NOT NULL;
```

Note: We don't need to specify `ORDER BY x` in the window function since the points are already sorted.

### 2. Optimized Join (If using a database that supports ROWS specification)

```SQL
SELECT MIN(p2.x - p1.x) AS shortest
FROM Point p1
JOIN Point p2 ON p2.x = (
    SELECT MIN(p.x)
    FROM Point p
    WHERE p.x > p1.x
);
```

### 3. Optimized Procedural Approach (Pseudo-code)

If implementing in a procedural language:

1. Retrieve the points in sorted order
2. Iterate through adjacent points, calculating differences
3. Keep track of the minimum difference

## Complexity Analysis

- Self-Join: O(n²) time complexity, O(n²) space complexity
- Window Function: O(n log n) time complexity (for sorting), O(n) space complexity
- Optimized for Sorted Points: O(n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity

## Conclusion

The most efficient approach depends on the data characteristics:

- If the data is already sorted, the window function approach is best with O(n) complexity
- If the data is unsorted but small, the self-join may be simple and effective
- For large unsorted datasets, sorting first then using window functions is typically optimal

This problem demonstrates the importance of understanding the characteristics of your data when optimizing SQL queries. The follow-up question also highlights how contextual knowledge (like data ordering) can lead to significant optimizations.
