**Description**

Table: `Cinema`

```Plain
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
```

Find all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

Return the result table **ordered** by `seat_id` **in ascending order**.

The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Cinema table:
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
Output:
+---------+
| seat_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
+---------+
```

To solve this problem, we need to identify all consecutive available seats in a cinema. A seat is considered part of a consecutive sequence if it is free and has at least one adjacent seat (either the previous or next seat) that is also free.

### Approach

1. **Identify Adjacent Seats**: For each seat, check the availability of the previous and next seats using self-joins on the cinema table.
2. **Check Availability Conditions**: A seat is included in the result if it is free and either the previous seat or the next seat is also free.
3. **Order Results**: The result is ordered by seat ID in ascending order to meet the problem's requirements.

### Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT c1.seat_id
FROM Cinema c1
LEFT JOIN Cinema c_prev ON c1.seat_id = c_prev.seat_id + 1
LEFT JOIN Cinema c_next ON c1.seat_id = c_next.seat_id - 1
WHERE c1.free = 1 AND (c_prev.free = 1 OR c_next.free = 1)
ORDER BY c1.seat_id;
```

### Explanation

1. **Self-Joins**: The cinema table is joined with itself to check the previous (`c_prev`) and next (`c_next`) seats. This allows us to determine the availability of adjacent seats.
2. **Conditions**: The main conditions ensure that the current seat is free (`c1.free = 1`) and at least one adjacent seat (either previous or next) is also free.
3. **Ordering**: The result is ordered by seat ID in ascending order to present the consecutive seats in the required sequence.

This approach efficiently checks for consecutive seats by leveraging self-joins and ensures that all valid consecutive seats are included in the result.
