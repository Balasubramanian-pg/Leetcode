**Description**

Table: `Customers`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
| email         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the email of a customer of an online shop.
```

Table: `Contacts`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | id      |
| contact_name  | varchar |
| contact_email | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(user_id, contact_email) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and email of one contact of customer with user_id.
This table contains information about people each customer trust. The contact may or may not exist in the Customers table.
```

Table: `Invoices`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| invoice_id   | int     |
| price        | int     |
| user_id      | int     |
+--------------+---------+
invoice_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id has an invoice with invoice_id and a price.
```

Write a solution to find the following for each `invoice_id`:

- `customer_name`: The name of the customer the invoice is related to.
- `price`: The price of the invoice.
- `contacts_cnt`: The number of contacts related to the customer.
- `trusted_contacts_cnt`: The number of contacts related  
    to the customer and at the same time they are customers to the shop.  
    (i.e their email exists in the  
    `Customers` table.)

Return the result table **ordered** by `invoice_id`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:
Alice has three contacts, two of them are trusted contacts (Bob and John).
Bob has two contacts, none of them is a trusted contact.
Alex has one contact and it is a trusted contact (Alice).
John doesn't have any contacts.
```

**Solutions**

Let me analyze this SQL problem and help you solve it.

## Problem Summary

We need to query data from three tables (Customers, Contacts, and Invoices) to return the following for each invoice:

1. Customer name
2. Price
3. Total count of contacts for the customer
4. Count of trusted contacts (contacts who are also customers)

The result should be ordered by invoice_id.

## Data Analysis

Let's understand the relationships between the tables:

- **Invoices**: Contains invoice information with user_id linking to customers
- **Customers**: Contains customer information
- **Contacts**: Contains contact information for each customer (user_id)

A trusted contact is someone who:

1. Is a contact of the customer (exists in Contacts table)
2. Is also a customer (their email exists in Customers table)

## SQL Solution Approach

We need to:

1. Join Invoices with Customers to get customer names and prices
2. Count contacts for each customer from the Contacts table
3. Count trusted contacts (contacts whose emails exist in Customers)
4. Order by invoice_id

Here's the solution:

```SQL
SELECT
    i.invoice_id,
    c.customer_name,
    i.price,
    COUNT(ct.contact_email) AS contacts_cnt,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ct.contact_email IN (SELECT email FROM Customers) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS trusted_contacts_cnt
FROM
    Invoices i
    JOIN Customers c ON i.user_id = c.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN Contacts ct ON i.user_id = ct.user_id
GROUP BY
    i.invoice_id, c.customer_name, i.price
ORDER BY
    i.invoice_id;
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Base Join**:
    - Join Invoices with Customers on user_id = customer_id to get customer names
    - Left join with Contacts to get all contacts for each customer
2. **Counting Contacts**:
    - `COUNT(ct.contact_email)` counts all contacts for each customer
    - The LEFT JOIN ensures we include customers with zero contacts
3. **Counting Trusted Contacts**:
    - The subquery `SELECT email FROM Customers` gets all customer emails
    - The CASE expression counts contacts whose emails appear in the Customers table
    - `SUM(CASE WHEN...)` adds up the trusted contacts
4. **Grouping and Ordering**:
    - Group by invoice_id, customer_name, and price to get one row per invoice
    - Order by invoice_id as required

## Example Walkthrough

Let's trace through a couple of examples:

1. **Invoice #77 (Alice)**:
    - Joins with Customers to get customer_name = "Alice"
    - Left joins with Contacts to find 3 contacts (Bob, John, Jal)
    - Among these contacts, Bob and John are also customers (trusted)
    - Result: invoice_id=77, customer_name=Alice, price=100, contacts_cnt=3, trusted_contacts_cnt=2
2. **Invoice #55 (John)**:
    - Joins with Customers to get customer_name = "John"
    - Left joins with Contacts but finds no contacts for John
    - Result: invoice_id=55, customer_name=John, price=500, contacts_cnt=0, trusted_contacts_cnt=0

This solution correctly handles all the requirements, including customers without contacts and proper counting of trusted contacts.

## Alternative Solution

An alternative approach could use an EXISTS clause for trusted contacts:

```SQL
SELECT
    i.invoice_id,
    c.customer_name,
    i.price,
    COUNT(ct.contact_email) AS contacts_cnt,
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM Customers c2
            WHERE c2.email = ct.contact_email
        ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    ) AS trusted_contacts_cnt
FROM
    Invoices i
    JOIN Customers c ON i.user_id = c.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN Contacts ct ON i.user_id = ct.user_id
GROUP BY
    i.invoice_id, c.customer_name, i.price
ORDER BY
    i.invoice_id;
```

Both solutions are effective, with the first potentially being more efficient for larger datasets.
