**Description**

Table: `Tasks`

```Plain
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| task_id       | int      |
| employee_id   | int      |
| start_time    | datetime |
| end_time      | datetime |
+---------------+----------+
(task_id, employee_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table contains the task identifier, the employee identifier, and the start and end times of each task.
```

Write a solution to find the **total duration** of tasks for **each** employee and the **maximum number of concurrent tasks** an employee handled at **any point in time**. The total duration should be **rounded down** to the nearest number of **full hours**.

Return _the result table ordered by_Â `employee_id` _**ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Tasks table:

```Plain
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| task_id | employee_id | start_time          | end_time            |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| 1       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 08:00:00 | 2023-05-01 09:00:00 |
| 2       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 08:30:00 | 2023-05-01 10:30:00 |
| 3       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 11:00:00 | 2023-05-01 12:00:00 |
| 7       | 1001        | 2023-05-01 13:00:00 | 2023-05-01 15:30:00 |
| 4       | 1002        | 2023-05-01 09:00:00 | 2023-05-01 10:00:00 |
| 5       | 1002        | 2023-05-01 09:30:00 | 2023-05-01 11:30:00 |
| 6       | 1003        | 2023-05-01 14:00:00 | 2023-05-01 16:00:00 |
+---------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+
| employee_id | total_task_hours | max_concurrent_tasks |
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+
| 1001        | 6                | 2                    |
| 1002        | 2                | 2                    |
| 1003        | 2                | 1                    |
+-------------+------------------+----------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For employee ID 1001:
    - Task 1 and Task 2 overlap from 08:30 to 09:00 (30 minutes).
    - Task 7 has a duration of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes).
    - Total task time: 60 (Task 1) + 120 (Task 2) + 60 (Task 3) + 150 (Task 7) - 30 (overlap) = 360 minutes = 6 hours.
    - Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).
- For employee ID 1002:
    - Task 4 and Task 5 overlap from 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).
    - Total task time: 60 (Task 4) + 120 (Task 5) - 30 (overlap) = 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.
    - Total task hours (rounded down): 2 hours.
    - Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).
- For employee ID 1003:
    - No overlapping tasks.
    - Total task time: 120 minutes = 2 hours.
    - Maximum concurrent tasks: 1.

**Note:** Output table is ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

  

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution.

Step 1: Understanding the problem  
We need to calculate two things for each employee:  

1. The total duration of all tasks (removing overlaps), rounded down to full hours
2. The maximum number of concurrent tasks an employee handled at any point

Let me explain this SQL solution step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
We need to calculate two metrics for each employee:  

1. The total duration of all tasks (removing overlaps), rounded down to full hours
2. The maximum number of concurrent tasks an employee handled at any point

This is a complex problem that requires us to:

- Identify overlapping tasks
- Calculate the total duration excluding overlaps
- Find the maximum number of tasks occurring simultaneously

Step 2: Finding Maximum Concurrent Tasks

```SQL
-- Step 1: Find the boundaries of each task
WITH task_boundaries AS (
    -- Each start_time adds 1 to the count of concurrent tasks
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        start_time AS time_point,
        1 AS value
    FROM
        Tasks

    UNION ALL

    -- Each end_time subtracts 1 from the count of concurrent tasks
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        end_time AS time_point,
        -1 AS value
    FROM
        Tasks
),

-- Step 2: Calculate concurrent tasks at each time point
concurrent_tasks AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        time_point,
        SUM(value) OVER (
            PARTITION BY employee_id
            ORDER BY time_point
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS concurrent_count
    FROM
        task_boundaries
),

-- Step 3: Find maximum concurrent tasks for each employee
max_concurrent AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        MAX(concurrent_count) AS max_concurrent_tasks
    FROM
        concurrent_tasks
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
)
```

Explanation:

- First, we create `task_boundaries` to mark every start and end time of tasks
    - Start times add 1 to our counter (task begins)
    - End times subtract 1 from our counter (task ends)
- Next, in `concurrent_tasks`, we use a running sum (window function) to calculate how many tasks are active at each time point
- Finally, in `max_concurrent`, we find the maximum number of concurrent tasks for each employee

Step 3: Calculating Total Task Duration (Excluding Overlaps)

```SQL
-- Step 4: Calculate non-overlapping task duration
task_duration AS (
    SELECT
        t1.employee_id,
        t1.task_id,
        t1.start_time,
        t1.end_time,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, t1.start_time, t1.end_time) AS duration_minutes,
        SUM(
            CASE
                WHEN (t2.start_time < t1.end_time AND t2.end_time > t1.start_time AND t2.task_id <> t1.task_id)
                THEN
                    TIMESTAMPDIFF(
                        MINUTE,
                        GREATEST(t1.start_time, t2.start_time),
                        LEAST(t1.end_time, t2.end_time)
                    )
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) / 2 AS overlap_minutes
    FROM
        Tasks t1
    LEFT JOIN
        Tasks t2
        ON t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id
        AND t1.task_id <> t2.task_id
        AND t2.start_time < t1.end_time
        AND t2.end_time > t1.start_time
    GROUP BY
        t1.employee_id, t1.task_id, t1.start_time, t1.end_time
),

-- Step 5: Sum up durations for each employee
total_duration AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        FLOOR(SUM(duration_minutes - overlap_minutes) / 60) AS total_task_hours
    FROM
        task_duration
    GROUP BY
        employee_id
)
```

Explanation:

- In `task_duration`, we:
    - Calculate the full duration of each task in minutes
    - Find overlapping periods with other tasks by self-joining the Tasks table
    - For each task, we calculate the total overlap minutes with other tasks
    - We divide by 2 because each overlap is counted twice (once for each task involved)
- In `total_duration`, we:
    - Subtract overlap minutes from the total duration for each task
    - Sum these adjusted durations for each employee
    - Convert minutes to hours and round down using FLOOR

Step 4: Final Result

```SQL
-- Step 6: Final result
SELECT
    t.employee_id,
    t.total_task_hours,
    m.max_concurrent_tasks
FROM
    total_duration t
JOIN
    max_concurrent m ON t.employee_id = m.employee_id
ORDER BY
    t.employee_id;
```

Explanation:

- We join the total duration and maximum concurrent tasks results
- Order by employee_id as required
- Return the final table with three columns: employee_id, total_task_hours, and max_concurrent_tasks

This solution correctly handles:

1. Overlapping tasks when calculating total duration
2. Finding the maximum number of tasks running concurrently
3. Converting minutes to full hours (rounded down)
4. Ordering the results by employee_id

For example, for employee 1001, tasks 1 and 2 overlap for 30 minutes, which is correctly accounted for in the total duration calculation, resulting in 6 hours. The maximum concurrent tasks is 2 during this overlap period.

```SQL
-- Step 1: Find the boundaries of each overlapping segment
WITH task_boundaries AS (
    -- Each start_time adds 1 to the count of concurrent tasks
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        start_time AS time_point,
        1 AS value
    FROM 
        Tasks
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Each end_time subtracts 1 from the count of concurrent tasks
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        end_time AS time_point,
        -1 AS value
    FROM 
        Tasks
),

-- Step 2: Calculate concurrent tasks at each time point
concurrent_tasks AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        time_point,
        SUM(value) OVER (
            PARTITION BY employee_id 
            ORDER BY time_point
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) AS concurrent_count
    FROM 
        task_boundaries
),

-- Step 3: Find maximum concurrent tasks for each employee
max_concurrent AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        MAX(concurrent_count) AS max_concurrent_tasks
    FROM 
        concurrent_tasks
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
),

-- Step 4: Calculate non-overlapping task duration
task_duration AS (
    SELECT 
        t1.employee_id,
        t1.task_id,
        t1.start_time,
        t1.end_time,
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, t1.start_time, t1.end_time) AS duration_minutes,
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN (t2.start_time < t1.end_time AND t2.end_time > t1.start_time AND t2.task_id <> t1.task_id)
                THEN 
                    TIMESTAMPDIFF(
                        MINUTE, 
                        GREATEST(t1.start_time, t2.start_time),
                        LEAST(t1.end_time, t2.end_time)
                    )
                ELSE 0
            END
        ) / 2 AS overlap_minutes
    FROM 
        Tasks t1
    LEFT JOIN 
        Tasks t2 
        ON t1.employee_id = t2.employee_id 
        AND t1.task_id <> t2.task_id
        AND t2.start_time < t1.end_time 
        AND t2.end_time > t1.start_time
    GROUP BY 
        t1.employee_id, t1.task_id, t1.start_time, t1.end_time
),

-- Step 5: Sum up durations for each employee
total_duration AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        FLOOR(SUM(duration_minutes - overlap_minutes) / 60) AS total_task_hours
    FROM 
        task_duration
    GROUP BY 
        employee_id
)

-- Step 6: Final result
SELECT 
    t.employee_id,
    t.total_task_hours,
    m.max_concurrent_tasks
FROM 
    total_duration t
JOIN 
    max_concurrent m ON t.employee_id = m.employee_id
ORDER BY 
    t.employee_id;
