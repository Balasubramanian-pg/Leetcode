**Description**

Table: `Students`

```Plain
+---------------+------+
| Column Name   | Type |
+---------------+------+
| student_id    | int  |
| department_id | int  |
| mark          | int  |
+---------------+------+
student_id contains unique values.
Each row of this table indicates a student's ID, the ID of the department in which the student enrolled, and their mark in the exam.
```

Write a solution to report the rank of each student in  
their department as a percentage, where the rank as a percentage is  
computed using the following formula:  
`(student_rank_in_the_department - 1) * 100 / (the_number_of_students_in_the_department - 1)`. The `percentage` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**. `student_rank_in_the_department` is determined by **descending** `mark`, such that the student with the highest `mark` is `rank 1`. If two students get the same mark, they also get the same rank.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Students table:
+------------+---------------+------+
| student_id | department_id | mark |
+------------+---------------+------+
| 2          | 2             | 650  |
| 8          | 2             | 650  |
| 7          | 1             | 920  |
| 1          | 1             | 610  |
| 3          | 1             | 530  |
+------------+---------------+------+
Output:
+------------+---------------+------------+
| student_id | department_id | percentage |
+------------+---------------+------------+
| 7          | 1             | 0.0        |
| 1          | 1             | 50.0       |
| 3          | 1             | 100.0      |
| 2          | 2             | 0.0        |
| 8          | 2             | 0.0        |
+------------+---------------+------------+
Explanation:
For Department 1:
 - Student 7: percentage = (1 - 1) * 100 / (3 - 1) = 0.0
 - Student 1: percentage = (2 - 1) * 100 / (3 - 1) = 50.0
 - Student 3: percentage = (3 - 1) * 100 / (3 - 1) = 100.0
For Department 2:
 - Student 2: percentage = (1 - 1) * 100 / (2 - 1) = 0.0
 - Student 8: percentage = (1 - 1) * 100 / (2 - 1) = 0.0
```

## Solutions

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step, explaining each part of the solution carefully.

Step 1: Understanding the Problem

```SQL
-- We need to calculate the percentage rank of each student within their department
-- Formula: (student_rank_in_the_department - 1) * 100 / (the_number_of_students_in_the_department - 1)
-- Ranks are determined by marks in descending order (higher mark = lower rank number)
-- Students with the same mark get the same rank
-- Result should be rounded to 2 decimal places
```

Explanation: This problem asks us to calculate a percentage rank for each student within their department. The rank is based on the student's mark (higher mark means better rank), and the percentage is calculated using a specific formula that normalizes the rank to a scale of 0-100%.

Step 2: Determining Student Rank Within Department

```SQL
SELECT
    student_id,
    department_id,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY mark DESC) as student_rank
FROM Students
```

Explanation: First, we need to determine each student's rank within their department. We use DENSE_RANK() to assign ranks based on marks in descending order. DENSE_RANK() ensures that students with the same mark get the same rank, and there are no gaps in the ranking.

Step 3: Counting Students in Each Department

```SQL
SELECT
    department_id,
    COUNT(*) as student_count
FROM Students
GROUP BY department_id
```

Explanation: Next, we need to count the number of students in each department to use in the percentage calculation formula.

Step 4: Combining Rank and Count Information

```SQL
WITH RankedStudents AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        department_id,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY mark DESC) as student_rank
    FROM Students
),
DepartmentCounts AS (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        COUNT(*) as student_count
    FROM Students
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT
    rs.student_id,
    rs.department_id,
    rs.student_rank,
    dc.student_count
FROM RankedStudents rs
JOIN DepartmentCounts dc ON rs.department_id = dc.department_id
```

Explanation: Now we combine the student rank information with the department count information using a JOIN operation on the department_id.

Step 5: Calculating the Percentage

```SQL
WITH RankedStudents AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        department_id,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY mark DESC) as student_rank
    FROM Students
),
DepartmentCounts AS (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        COUNT(*) as student_count
    FROM Students
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT
    rs.student_id,
    rs.department_id,
    ROUND((rs.student_rank - 1) * 100.0 / (dc.student_count - 1), 2) as percentage
FROM RankedStudents rs
JOIN DepartmentCounts dc ON rs.department_id = dc.department_id
```

Explanation: Finally, we apply the formula provided in the problem: (student_rank - 1) * 100 / (student_count - 1). We use ROUND() to round the result to 2 decimal places as required.

Step 6: Handling Edge Case (Department with Only One Student)

```SQL
WITH RankedStudents AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        department_id,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY mark DESC) as student_rank
    FROM Students
),
DepartmentCounts AS (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        COUNT(*) as student_count
    FROM Students
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT
    rs.student_id,
    rs.department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN dc.student_count = 1 THEN 0.0
        ELSE ROUND((rs.student_rank - 1) * 100.0 / (dc.student_count - 1), 2)
    END as percentage
FROM RankedStudents rs
JOIN DepartmentCounts dc ON rs.department_id = dc.department_id
```

Explanation: We need to handle the edge case where a department has only one student. In this case, the denominator of our formula would be 0, which would cause a division by zero error. To handle this, we use a CASE statement to return 0.0 when the student count is 1.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH RankedStudents AS (
    SELECT
        student_id,
        department_id,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY mark DESC) as student_rank
    FROM Students
),
DepartmentCounts AS (
    SELECT
        department_id,
        COUNT(*) as student_count
    FROM Students
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT
    rs.student_id,
    rs.department_id,
    CASE
        WHEN dc.student_count = 1 THEN 0.0
        ELSE ROUND((rs.student_rank - 1) * 100.0 / (dc.student_count - 1), 2)
    END as percentage
FROM RankedStudents rs
JOIN DepartmentCounts dc ON rs.department_id = dc.department_id
```

Explanation: The final solution:

1. Calculates each student's rank within their department using DENSE_RANK()
2. Counts the number of students in each department
3. Joins these two pieces of information
4. Applies the percentage formula: (student_rank - 1) * 100 / (student_count - 1)
5. Handles the edge case of a department with only one student
6. Rounds the result to 2 decimal places
