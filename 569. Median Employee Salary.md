**Description**

Table: `Employee`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| company      | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the company and the salary of one employee.
```

Write a solution to find the rows that contain the median salary of each company. While calculating the median, when you sort the salaries of the company, break the ties by `id`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Employee table:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 1  | A       | 2341   |
| 2  | A       | 341    |
| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
| 11 | B       | 1221   |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
| 15 | C       | 2645   |
| 16 | C       | 2652   |
| 17 | C       | 65     |
+----+---------+--------+
Output:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
+----+---------+--------+
Explanation:
For company A, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 2  | A       | 341    |
| 5  | A       | 451    | <-- median
| 6  | A       | 513    | <-- median
| 1  | A       | 2341   |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
+----+---------+--------+
For company B, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 12 | B       | 234    | <-- median
| 11 | B       | 1221   | <-- median
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
+----+---------+--------+
For company C, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 17 | C       | 65     |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   | <-- median
| 15 | C       | 2645   |
| 16 | C       | 2652   |
+----+---------+--------+
```

### **Approach 1: Window Function (**`**ROW_NUMBER()**` **with Corrected Order)**

**Goal**: Identify median salary rows by accounting for even/odd employee counts and tie-breaking with `id`.

### Steps:

1. **Assign Row Numbers and Count Employees**:
    
    - Partition by `company` and order by `salary ASC, id ASC` to break ties.
    - Compute total employees per company (`n`).
    
    ```SQL
    WITH t AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY company
                ORDER BY salary ASC, id ASC  -- Corrected: Added id for tie-breaker
            ) AS rk,
            COUNT(id) OVER (PARTITION BY company) AS n
        FROM Employee
    )
    ```
    
2. **Filter Median Rows**:
    
    - For even `n`, select rows where `rk` is `n/2` or `n/2 + 1`.
    - For odd `n`, select the single middle row where `rk = (n+1)/2`.
    
    ```SQL
    SELECT
        id,
        company,
        salary
    FROM t
    WHERE
        (n % 2 = 0 AND rk BETWEEN n/2 AND n/2 + 1)
        OR (n % 2 = 1 AND rk = (n+1)/2);
    ```
    

### Why This Works:

- `ORDER BY salary ASC, id ASC` ensures deterministic ordering for tie-breaking.
- `n % 2` checks if the employee count is even/odd to select the correct median row(s).
- For odd `n`, `(n+1)/2` gives the exact middle row. For even `n`, `n/2` and `n/2 + 1` are the two middle rows.

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH t AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY company
            ORDER BY salary ASC, id ASC  -- Tie-breaker added
        ) AS rk,
        COUNT(id) OVER (PARTITION BY company) AS n
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT
    id,
    company,
    salary
FROM t
WHERE
    (n % 2 = 0 AND rk BETWEEN n/2 AND n/2 + 1)
    OR (n % 2 = 1 AND rk = (n+1)/2);
```

---

**Explanation of Corrections**:

1. **Tie-Breaking**: Added `id ASC` to `ORDER BY` to handle employees with the same salary.
2. **Median Logic**: Used `n % 2` to distinguish between even/odd employee counts and select the correct rows.

**Example Validation**:

- **Company C (n=5)**: Only row with `rk=3` (id=14) is selected.
- **Company A (n=6)**: Rows with `rk=3` (id=5) and `rk=4` (id=6) are selected.
