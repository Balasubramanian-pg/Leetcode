**Description**

Table: `user_transactions`

```Plain
+------------------+----------+
| Column Name      | Type     |
+------------------+----------+
| transaction_id   | integer  |
| product_id       | integer  |
| spend            | decimal  |
| transaction_date | datetime |
+------------------+----------+
The transaction_id column uniquely identifies each row in this table.
Each row of this table contains the transaction ID, product ID, the spend amount, and the transaction date.
```

Write a solution to calculate the **year-on-year growth rate** for the total spend **for each product**.

The result table should include the following columns:

- `year`: The year of the transaction.
- `product_id`: The ID of the product.
- `curr_year_spend`: The total spend for the current year.
- `prev_year_spend`: The total spend for the previous year.
- `yoy_rate`: The year-on-year growth rate percentage, rounded to `2` decimal places.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `product_id`,`year` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

`user_transactions` table:

```Plain
+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| transaction_id | product_id | spend   | transaction_date    |
+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
| 1341           | 123424     | 1500.60 | 2019-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1423           | 123424     | 1000.20 | 2020-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1623           | 123424     | 1246.44 | 2021-12-31 12:00:00 |
| 1322           | 123424     | 2145.32 | 2022-12-31 12:00:00 |
+----------------+------------+---------+---------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------+
| year | product_id | curr_year_spend| prev_year_spend| yoy_rate |
+------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------+
| 2019 | 123424     | 1500.60        | NULL           | NULL     |
| 2020 | 123424     | 1000.20        | 1500.60        | -33.35   |
| 2021 | 123424     | 1246.44        | 1000.20        | 24.62    |
| 2022 | 123424     | 2145.32        | 1246.44        | 72.12    |
+------+------------+----------------+----------------+----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- For product ID 123424:
    - In 2019:
        - Current year's spend is 1500.60
        - No previous year's spend recorded
        - YoY growth rate: NULL
    - In 2020:
        - Current year's spend is 1000.20
        - Previous year's spend is 1500.60
        - YoY growth rate: ((1000.20 - 1500.60) / 1500.60) * 100 = -33.35%
    - In 2021:
        - Current year's spend is 1246.44
        - Previous year's spend is 1000.20
        - YoY growth rate: ((1246.44 - 1000.20) / 1000.20) * 100 = 24.62%
    - In 2022:
        - Current year's spend is 2145.32
        - Previous year's spend is 1246.44
        - YoY growth rate: ((2145.32 - 1246.44) / 1246.44) * 100 = 72.12%

**Note:** Output table is ordered by `product_id` and `year` in ascending order.

  

Let’s break down the solution step-by-step, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to calculate the **year-on-year (YoY) growth rate** for each product's total spend. The result should include:

1. **year**: The year of the transaction.
2. **product_id**: The ID of the product.
3. **curr_year_spend**: Total spend for the current year.
4. **prev_year_spend**: Total spend for the previous year.
5. **yoy_rate**: The YoY growth rate percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Key Points:**

- Extract the year from `transaction_date`.
- Calculate total spend per year and product.
- Compute YoY growth rate using the formula:  
    \[  
    \text{YoY Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{curr\_year\_spend} - \text{prev\_year\_spend}}{\text{prev\_year\_spend}} \right) \times 100  
    \]  
    

---

### **Step 2: Extract Year and Calculate Total Spend**

First, extract the year from `transaction_date` and calculate the total spend for each product and year.

```SQL
WITH YearlySpend AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(transaction_date) AS year,
        product_id,
        SUM(spend) AS curr_year_spend
    FROM
        user_transactions
    GROUP BY
        YEAR(transaction_date), product_id
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**YEAR(transaction_date)**`: Extracts the year from the `transaction_date`.
- `**SUM(spend)**`: Calculates the total spend for each product and year.
- `**GROUP BY YEAR(transaction_date), product_id**`: Groups the data by year and product.

---

### **Step 3: Join with Previous Year’s Data**

Next, join the yearly spend data with itself to get the previous year’s spend for each product.

```SQL
, YearlySpendWithPrev AS (
    SELECT
        ys1.year,
        ys1.product_id,
        ys1.curr_year_spend,
        ys2.curr_year_spend AS prev_year_spend
    FROM
        YearlySpend ys1
    LEFT JOIN
        YearlySpend ys2
    ON
        ys1.product_id = ys2.product_id
        AND ys1.year = ys2.year + 1
)
```

**Explanation:**

- `**LEFT JOIN**`: Joins the current year’s data (`ys1`) with the previous year’s data (`ys2`).
- `**ON ys1.product_id = ys2.product_id AND ys1.year = ys2.year + 1**`: Matches the current year with the previous year for the same product.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate YoY Growth Rate**

Finally, calculate the YoY growth rate and round it to 2 decimal places.

```SQL
SELECT
    year,
    product_id,
    curr_year_spend,
    prev_year_spend,
    ROUND(
        CASE
            WHEN prev_year_spend IS NOT NULL AND prev_year_spend != 0
            THEN ((curr_year_spend - prev_year_spend) / prev_year_spend) * 100
            ELSE NULL
        END,
        2
    ) AS yoy_rate
FROM
    YearlySpendWithPrev
ORDER BY
    product_id, year;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**CASE**` **Statement**: Handles cases where `prev_year_spend` is `NULL` or `0` to avoid division errors.
- `**ROUND(..., 2)**`: Rounds the YoY rate to 2 decimal places.
- `**ORDER BY product_id, year**`: Orders the result by `product_id` and `year`.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
WITH YearlySpend AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(transaction_date) AS year,
        product_id,
        SUM(spend) AS curr_year_spend
    FROM
        user_transactions
    GROUP BY
        YEAR(transaction_date), product_id
),
YearlySpendWithPrev AS (
    SELECT
        ys1.year,
        ys1.product_id,
        ys1.curr_year_spend,
        ys2.curr_year_spend AS prev_year_spend
    FROM
        YearlySpend ys1
    LEFT JOIN
        YearlySpend ys2
    ON
        ys1.product_id = ys2.product_id
        AND ys1.year = ys2.year + 1
)
SELECT
    year,
    product_id,
    curr_year_spend,
    prev_year_spend,
    ROUND(
        CASE
            WHEN prev_year_spend IS NOT NULL AND prev_year_spend != 0
            THEN ((curr_year_spend - prev_year_spend) / prev_year_spend) * 100
            ELSE NULL
        END,
        2
    ) AS yoy_rate
FROM
    YearlySpendWithPrev
ORDER BY
    product_id, year;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **CTEs**: Break down the problem into manageable parts.
2. **Year Extraction**: Extracts the year from `transaction_date`.
3. **Total Spend**: Calculates the total spend for each product and year.
4. **Join with Previous Year**: Matches current year data with previous year data.
5. **YoY Calculation**: Computes the YoY growth rate and handles edge cases.
6. **Ordering**: Orders the result by `product_id` and `year`.

This query returns the desired output with the YoY growth rate calculated for each product and year.
