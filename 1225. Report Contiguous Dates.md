**Description**

Table: `Failed`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.
```

Table: `Succeeded`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
```

A system is running one task **every day**. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write a solution to report the `period_state` for each continuous interval of days in the period from `2019-01-01` to `2019-12-31`.

`period_state` is _'_`failed'` if tasks in this interval failed or `'succeeded'` if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as `start_date` and `end_date.`

Return the result table ordered by `start_date`.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+
Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+
Output:
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation:
The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and the system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Union + Window Function + Group By**

We can merge the two tables into one table with a field `st` representing the status, where `failed` indicates failure and `succeeded`indicates success. Then, we can use a window function to group the records with the same status into one group, and calculate the difference between each date and its rank within the group as `pt`, which serves as the identifier for the same continuous status. Finally, we can group by `st` and `pt`, and calculate the minimum and maximum dates for each group, and sort by the minimum date.

  

This SQL solution segments a year's worth of task outcomes (`failed` or `succeeded`) into **continuous intervals** based on system behavior. The logic is clean, efficient, and relies on **window functions** and **date arithmetic** to group contiguous states.

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1. Data Consolidation**

```SQL
WITH T AS (
    SELECT fail_date AS dt, 'failed' AS st
    FROM Failed
    WHERE YEAR(fail_date) = 2019

    UNION ALL

    SELECT success_date AS dt, 'succeeded' AS st
    FROM Succeeded
    WHERE YEAR(success_date) = 2019
)
```

- This CTE (`T`) combines both the `Failed` and `Succeeded` tables into a **unified table**:
    - `dt`: the date of the task.
    - `st`: the state of the task ('failed' or 'succeeded').
- Filters only data from the year **2019**.
- `UNION ALL` preserves duplicates (though dates are unique here by design).

---

### **2. Group Identification Using Date Offset Logic**

```SQL
SELECT
    *,
    SUBDATE(
        dt,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY st
            ORDER BY dt
        )
    ) AS pt
FROM T
```

- Each row is assigned a **rank** within its status (`st`) group (either 'failed' or 'succeeded'), ordered by date.
- By **subtracting the rank from the date**, we create a normalized value `pt` that is **constant for contiguous intervals**.

**How this works**:

- Suppose dates are `2019-01-01`, `2019-01-02`, `2019-01-03` with ranks 1, 2, 3:
    - `pt = dt - rank` → all three yield `2018-12-31`.
- A **gap** in the sequence will shift the result of `dt - rank`, thus defining a new group.

---

### **3. Grouping by Status and Offset to Determine Ranges**

```SQL
SELECT
    st AS period_state,
    MIN(dt) AS start_date,
    MAX(dt) AS end_date
FROM (
    ...
) AS t
GROUP BY 1, pt
ORDER BY 2;
```

- This final step groups the temporary table `t` by:
    - `st`: the status.
    - `pt`: the artificial group ID (identifies contiguous ranges).
- `MIN(dt)` and `MAX(dt)` produce the start and end of each contiguous period.
- Ordered by `start_date`.

## **Key Concepts Used**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Concept|Purpose|
|`UNION ALL`|Merge failed and succeeded dates into one table.|
|`RANK()` window function|Assign sequential numbers within each status group.|
|`SUBDATE(dt, rank)`|Derive a grouping key to identify contiguous date ranges.|
|`GROUP BY st, pt`|Group by status and the artificial key for continuous intervals.|
|`MIN`, `MAX`|Determine the start and end dates of each period.|

---

## **Output**

A dataset of:

- `period_state`: failed or succeeded
- `start_date`, `end_date`: start and end of the contiguous run of that state
