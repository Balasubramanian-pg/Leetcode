**Description**

Table: `books`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| book_id        | int     |
| title          | varchar |
| author         | varchar |
| published_year | int     |
| rating         | decimal |
+----------------+---------+
book_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about a book including its unique ID, title, author, publication year, and rating.
rating can be NULL, indicating that the book hasn't been rated yet.
```

Write a solution to find all books that have not been rated yet (i.e., have a **NULL** rating).

Return _the result table ordered by_ `book_id` in **ascending** order.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

books table:

```Plain
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+--------+
| book_id | title                  | author           | published_year | rating |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+--------+
| 1       | The Great Gatsby       | F. Scott         | 1925           | 4.5    |
| 2       | To Kill a Mockingbird  | Harper Lee       | 1960           | NULL   |
| 3       | Pride and Prejudice    | Jane Austen      | 1813           | 4.8    |
| 4       | The Catcher in the Rye | J.D. Salinger    | 1951           | NULL   |
| 5       | Animal Farm            | George Orwell    | 1945           | 4.2    |
| 6       | Lord of the Flies      | William Golding  | 1954           | NULL   |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+--------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+
| book_id | title                  | author           | published_year |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+
| 2       | To Kill a Mockingbird  | Harper Lee       | 1960           |
| 4       | The Catcher in the Rye | J.D. Salinger    | 1951           |
| 6       | Lord of the Flies      | William Golding  | 1954           |
+---------+------------------------+------------------+----------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- The books with book_id 2, 4, and 6 have NULL ratings.
- These books are included in the result table.
- The other books (book_id 1, 3, and 5) have ratings and are not included.

The result is ordered by book_id in ascending order

<Inner Monologue>  
This problem is quite straightforward. We need to:  

1. Find all books where the rating is NULL
2. Return the book_id, title, author, and published_year (excluding the rating column)
3. Order the results by book_id in ascending order

To filter for NULL values in SQL, we use the `IS NULL` operator rather than `= NULL` (which wouldn't work correctly). So I'll need to use a WHERE clause with `rating IS NULL`.

Let me write the SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT book_id, title, author, published_year
FROM books
WHERE rating IS NULL
ORDER BY book_id ASC;
```

Let's verify this against the example data:

- book_id 1: rating is 4.5, so it's excluded
- book_id 2: rating is NULL, so it's included
- book_id 3: rating is 4.8, so it's excluded
- book_id 4: rating is NULL, so it's included
- book_id 5: rating is 4.2, so it's excluded
- book_id 6: rating is NULL, so it's included

So my query should return book_id 2, 4, and 6, which matches the expected output. The query will also order them by book_id in ascending order, which is also what the expected output shows.

This is a very simple query that doesn't require any joins, subqueries, or complex window functions. It's just a basic SELECT with a WHERE clause to filter for NULL values and an ORDER BY clause to sort the results.

One quick check: the problem asks to return book_id, title, author, and published_year. The output format shown includes these columns and excludes the rating column (which would be NULL anyway). My query selects only these required columns, so it should be correct.

```SQL

SELECT book_id, title, author, published_year
FROM books
WHERE rating IS NULL
ORDER BY book_id ASC;
```

This problem asks us to find all books that haven't been rated yet (those with NULL ratings). The solution is straightforward but demonstrates an important SQL concept - handling NULL values.

First, let me explain my approach:

1. **Selection**: I'm selecting only the required columns from the books table:
    
    - book_id
    - title
    - author
    - published_year
    
    Note that I'm excluding the rating column since it's not needed in the output and would be NULL for all results anyway.
    
2. **NULL filtering**: To filter for NULL values, I use the `IS NULL` operator in the WHERE clause. This is a critical detail in SQL - we cannot use `= NULL` for comparison because NULL represents the absence of a value and doesn't equal anything (not even another NULL).
3. **Sorting**: Finally, I order the results by book_id in ascending order as requested.

The query elegantly handles the core requirement of finding unrated books. When executed on the example data:

- Book ID 2 (To Kill a Mockingbird): Has NULL rating → Included
- Book ID 4 (The Catcher in the Rye): Has NULL rating → Included
- Book ID 6 (Lord of the Flies): Has NULL rating → Included
- Other books have non-NULL ratings → Excluded

While this is a simple query, it highlights the special handling required for NULL values in SQL, which is a fundamental concept that often appears in more complex database problems.
