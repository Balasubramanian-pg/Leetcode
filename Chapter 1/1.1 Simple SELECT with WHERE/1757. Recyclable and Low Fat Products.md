Table: `Products`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output:
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.
```

# Solution to Find Products That Are Both Low Fat and Recyclable

To solve this problem, I need to query the `Products` table to find all product IDs where both `low_fats` is 'Y' (meaning low fat) and `recyclable` is 'Y' (meaning recyclable).

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

## Explanation

1. The `SELECT product_id` statement specifies that we only want to retrieve the product IDs from the results.
2. `FROM Products` indicates we're querying the Products table.
3. The `WHERE` clause has two conditions combined with `AND`:
    - `low_fats = 'Y'` ensures we only include low-fat products
    - `recyclable = 'Y'` ensures we only include recyclable products
4. Only products that satisfy both conditions will be included in the result set.

For the given example, this query would return product IDs 1 and 3, as these are the only products marked as both low fat ('Y') and recyclable ('Y').
