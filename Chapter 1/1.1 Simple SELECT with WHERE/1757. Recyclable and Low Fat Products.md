# Recyclable and Low-Fat Products (Conditional Select)

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem demonstrates basic filtering using WHERE clause with multiple conditions in SQL, specifically targeting ENUM type columns.

## 1. Problem Description

### 1.1 Table Structure

> [!TIP]  
> The Products table uses ENUM types for categorical data (Y/N values), which are efficient for storage and querying.

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> product_id is the primary key, ensuring each product has a unique identifier.

### 1.2 Requirements

> [!CAUTION]  
> The solution must precisely identify products that satisfy BOTH conditions simultaneously (low fat AND recyclable).

## 2. Solution Approach

### 2.1 Conditional Filtering Concept

> [!TIP]  
> Using AND operator in WHERE clause allows combining multiple conditions that must all be true for a row to be selected.

> [!WARNING]  
> Confusing AND with OR would produce incorrect results by selecting products that meet either condition separately.

### 2.2 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The query filters for rows where both low_fats and recyclable columns have the value 'Y'.

## 3. Example Output

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The output shows only products 1 and 3 meet both criteria in the sample data.

```
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

## 4. Alternative Approaches

### 4.1 Using Parentheses for Clarity

> [!TIP]  
> While not necessary here, parentheses can make complex conditions more readable.

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE (low_fats = 'Y') AND (recyclable = 'Y');
```

### 4.2 Using CASE Statements (Advanced)

> [!NOTE]  
> For more complex conditional logic, CASE statements could be used, though they're overkill for this simple scenario.

## 5. Performance Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For large tables, consider adding indexes on the low_fats and recyclable columns if this query runs frequently.

## 6. Common Mistakes

> [!CAUTION]  
> A frequent error is omitting the single quotes around 'Y', which would cause syntax errors in most SQL dialects.

> [!WARNING]  
> Another common mistake is using = instead of proper comparison operators when working with different data types.

## 7. Real-World Application

> [!TIP]  
> This type of filtering is commonly used in e-commerce systems to allow customers to filter products by multiple attributes.
