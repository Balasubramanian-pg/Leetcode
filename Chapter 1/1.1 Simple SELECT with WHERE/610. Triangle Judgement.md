# Triangle Judgement (Triangle Inequality Theorem)

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem demonstrates the application of the triangle inequality theorem to determine if three given lengths can form a valid triangle.

## 1. Problem Description

### 1.1 Table Structure

> [!TIP]  
> The Triangle table contains three integer columns representing potential triangle side lengths.

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| x           | int  |
| y           | int  |
| z           | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The triangle inequality theorem requires checking all three possible side combinations.

### 1.2 Requirements

> [!CAUTION]  
> The solution must evaluate all three conditions of the triangle inequality theorem, not just one or two.

## 2. Solution Approach

### 2.1 Triangle Inequality Concept

> [!TIP]  
> For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

> [!WARNING]  
> The comparison must be strictly greater than (not equal to) for a valid triangle.

### 2.2 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT
    x,
    y,
    z,
    CASE
        WHEN (x + y > z) AND (x + z > y) AND (y + z > x) THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The CASE statement efficiently evaluates all three required conditions in a single pass.

## 3. Example Output

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The output clearly shows which triplets satisfy the triangle conditions.

```
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+
```

## 4. Alternative Approaches

### 4.1 Using Multiple CASE Statements

> [!TIP]  
> This alternative might be more readable for some, though functionally equivalent.

```sql
SELECT
    x, y, z,
    CASE
        WHEN x + y <= z THEN 'No'
        WHEN x + z <= y THEN 'No'
        WHEN y + z <= x THEN 'No'
        ELSE 'Yes'
    END AS triangle
FROM Triangle;
```

## 5. Performance Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For large datasets, the query performance is optimal as it only requires simple arithmetic comparisons.

## 6. Common Mistakes

> [!CAUTION]  
> A frequent error is only checking two of the three required conditions.

> [!WARNING]  
> Another mistake is using >= instead of >, which would incorrectly allow degenerate triangles.

## 7. Mathematical Insight

> [!TIP]  
> The triangle inequality theorem is fundamental in geometry and has applications in various algorithms and computer graphics.

## 8. Edge Cases

> [!NOTE]  
> The solution correctly handles edge cases where one or more sides are zero or negative (implicitly returning 'No').

## 9. Real-World Application

> [!TIP]  
> This type of validation is used in 3D modeling, game development, and CAD software to ensure valid geometric shapes.
