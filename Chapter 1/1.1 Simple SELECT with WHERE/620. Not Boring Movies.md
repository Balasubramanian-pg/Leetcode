# Non-Boring Movies with Odd IDs

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem combines conditional filtering with sorting to identify interesting movies from a cinema database.

## 1. Problem Description

### 1.1 Table Structure

> [!TIP]  
> The Cinema table contains movie metadata including a unique ID, title, description and rating.

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The solution requires checking two independent conditions (odd ID and non-boring description).

### 1.2 Requirements

> [!CAUTION]  
> Must precisely filter for odd-numbered IDs and exclude any movies marked as "boring".

## 2. Solution Approach

### 2.1 Filtering Concept

> [!TIP]  
> Using modulo operator (%) is an efficient way to check for odd numbers in SQL.

> [!WARNING]  
> String comparisons in SQL are case-sensitive by default, so "Boring" would be treated differently from "boring".

### 2.2 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The ORDER BY clause ensures results are presented from highest to lowest rating.

## 3. Example Output

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The output shows only non-boring, odd-ID movies sorted by rating.

```
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
```

## 4. Alternative Approaches

### 4.1 Using MOD() Function

> [!TIP]  
> Some SQL dialects prefer MOD() function over % operator for better readability.

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

### 4.2 Case-Insensitive Comparison

> [!NOTE]  
> For case-insensitive matching, consider using LOWER() function.

```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND LOWER(description) != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

## 5. Performance Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For large tables, indexes on id and rating columns would improve query performance.

## 6. Common Mistakes

> [!CAUTION]  
> Forgetting the ORDER BY clause would return results in arbitrary order.

> [!WARNING]  
> Using OR instead of AND would incorrectly include movies that meet either condition.

## 7. Real-World Application

> [!TIP]  
> This type of filtering is common in recommendation systems to surface interesting content.

## 8. Edge Cases

> [!NOTE]  
> The solution handles NULL descriptions correctly by excluding them from results.

## 9. Extended Filtering

> [!TIP]  
> Additional conditions could be added to further refine movie selections, such as minimum rating thresholds.
