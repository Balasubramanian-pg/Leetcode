Table: `Cinema`

```Plain
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
```

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not `"boring"`.

Return the result table ordered by `rating` **in descending order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation:
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.
```

# Finding Non-Boring Odd-ID Movies

To solve this problem, I need to find movies that have:

1. Odd-numbered IDs (1, 3, 5, etc.)
2. Descriptions that are not "boring"  
    And then sort them by rating in descending order.  
    

## Approach

1. **Filter Conditions**: Select movies where:
    - `id % 2 = 1` (odd-numbered ID)
    - `description != 'boring'` (not boring)
2. **Sorting**: Order the results by `rating` in descending order
3. **Select All Columns**: Return all columns for the matching movies

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

## Explanation

- The `WHERE` clause filters for odd-numbered IDs using `id % 2 = 1`
- It also excludes "boring" movies with `description != 'boring'`
- The `ORDER BY rating DESC` sorts the remaining movies from highest to lowest rating
- In the example:
    - IDs 1, 3, and 5 are odd
    - ID 3 is excluded for being "boring"
    - The remaining movies (IDs 1 and 5) are sorted by rating (9.1 first, then 8.9)

This solution efficiently combines filtering and sorting operations to produce the required result.
