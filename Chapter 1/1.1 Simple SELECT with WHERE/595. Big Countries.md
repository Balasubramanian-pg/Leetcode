# Identifying Big Countries (Conditional Select with OR)

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem demonstrates the use of OR operator in SQL WHERE clauses to select records that meet at least one of multiple criteria.

## 1. Problem Description

### 1.1 Table Structure

> [!TIP]  
> The World table contains comprehensive country data with numeric metrics for area and population.

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |
+-------------+---------+
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The 'big country' definition uses two distinct metrics (area OR population) with different threshold values.

### 1.2 Requirements

> [!CAUTION]  
> The solution must include countries that satisfy EITHER condition, not necessarily both.

## 2. Solution Approach

### 2.1 OR Operator Concept

> [!TIP]  
> Using OR allows a record to match if it satisfies any of the specified conditions, unlike AND which requires all conditions.

> [!WARNING]  
> Be careful with operator precedence when combining AND/OR - use parentheses when needed.

### 2.2 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> The query returns name, population and area only for countries meeting at least one 'big country' criterion.

## 3. Example Output

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The output shows Afghanistan qualifies by population, while Algeria qualifies by both metrics.

```
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+
```

## 4. Alternative Approaches

### 4.1 Using UNION

> [!TIP]  
> For very large tables, UNION of two separate queries might sometimes perform better.

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000
UNION
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE population >= 25000000;
```

### 4.2 Using CASE in SELECT

> [!NOTE]  
> While unnecessary here, CASE could identify which condition(s) each country met.

## 5. Performance Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For optimal performance with OR conditions, consider having separate indexes on area and population columns.

## 6. Common Mistakes

> [!CAUTION]  
> A frequent error is using AND instead of OR, which would only find countries meeting BOTH criteria.

> [!WARNING]  
> Another mistake is not using the correct numeric literals (3000000 vs 3,000,000).

## 7. Real-World Application

> [!TIP]  
> This type of filtering is common in business intelligence for segmenting data by multiple alternative criteria.
