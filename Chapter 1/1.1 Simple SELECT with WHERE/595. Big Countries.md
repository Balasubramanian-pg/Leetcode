Table: `World`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
| area        | int     |
| population  | int     |
| gdp         | bigint  |
+-------------+---------+
name is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table gives information about the name of a country, the continent to which it belongs, its area, the population, and its GDP value.
```

A country is **big** if:

- it has an area of at least three million (i.e., `3000000 km2`), or
- it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., `25000000`).

Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the **big countries**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
World table:
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
+-------------+-----------+---------+------------+--------------+
Output:
+-------------+------------+---------+
| name        | population | area    |
+-------------+------------+---------+
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
+-------------+------------+---------+
```

# Solution to Find Big Countries

To solve this problem, I need to query the `World` table to find all countries that meet at least one of the "big country" criteria:

1. Area of at least 3 million (area >= 3000000), or
2. Population of at least 25 million (population >= 25000000)

## SQL Solution

```SQL
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

## Explanation

1. The `SELECT name, population, area` statement specifies we want to retrieve these three columns for our results.
2. `FROM World` indicates we're querying the World table.
3. The `WHERE` clause has two conditions combined with `OR`:
    - `area >= 3000000` checks for countries with large area
    - `population >= 25000000` checks for countries with large population
4. The `OR` operator ensures that either condition being true will include the country in the results.

For the given example:

- Afghanistan qualifies because its population (25,500,100) is ≥ 25 million
- Algeria qualifies because both its area (2,381,741) is ≥ 3 million and population (37,100,000) is ≥ 25 million
- The other countries don't meet either criteria

The output correctly lists Afghanistan and Algeria as the big countries based on the given criteria.
