# Identifying Invalid Tweets (Character Length Validation)

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem demonstrates how to filter records based on string length criteria in SQL, a common requirement for content validation.

## 1. Problem Description

### 1.1 Table Structure

> [!TIP]  
> The Tweets table contains tweet metadata with content that must be validated for length.

```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The validation requires counting all characters in the content, including spaces and punctuation.

### 1.2 Requirements

> [!CAUTION]  
> The solution must precisely identify tweets where the total character count exceeds 15, including all spaces and special characters.

## 2. Solution Approach

### 2.1 Length Validation Concept

> [!TIP]  
> Using CHAR_LENGTH ensures accurate character counting across all SQL dialects, especially important for databases where LENGTH might count bytes instead.

> [!WARNING]  
> The comparison must be strictly greater than 15 ("invalid" starts at 16 characters).

### 2.2 SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> CHAR_LENGTH is the SQL standard function for counting characters and works consistently across different database systems.

## 3. Example Output

> [!EXAMPLE]  
> The output correctly identifies tweets exceeding the 15-character limit.

```
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
```

## 4. Alternative Approaches

### 4.1 Using LENGTH Function

> [!TIP]  
> In databases where LENGTH counts characters (not bytes), this simpler version works:

```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

### 4.2 Database-Specific Solutions

> [!NOTE]  
> For specific databases:
> - MySQL: `CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15` or `CHARACTER_LENGTH(content) > 15`
> - SQL Server: `LEN(content) > 15`
> - PostgreSQL/SQLite: `LENGTH(content) > 15`

## 5. Performance Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For large tables, consider adding a computed column or index on the character length for faster filtering.

## 6. Common Mistakes

> [!CAUTION]  
> Using LENGTH in MySQL without considering it counts bytes for multi-byte characters.

> [!WARNING]  
> Forgetting that the comparison is strictly greater than (not greater than or equal to).

## 7. Real-World Application

> [!TIP]  
> Similar length validation is used in social media platforms, SMS systems, and form input validation.

## 8. Edge Cases

> [!NOTE]  
> The solution correctly handles:
> - NULL content (excluded from results)
> - Empty strings (length 0)
> - Content with only spaces/punctuation

## 9. Character Counting Details

> [!TIP]  
> CHAR_LENGTH counts:
> - All letters and numbers
> - Spaces
> - Punctuation marks like '!'
> - Each character in multi-byte sequences (if present)
