**Description**

Table: `Tweets`

```Plain
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.
```

Write a solution to find **invalid tweets**. A tweet is considered invalid if it meets **any** of the following criteria:

- It exceeds `140` characters in length.
- It has more than `3` mentions.
- It includes more than `3` hashtags.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `tweet_id` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

Tweets table:

```Plain
  +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | tweet_id | content                                                                           |
  +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | 1        | Traveling, exploring, and living my best life @JaneSmith @SaraJohnson @LisaTaylor |
  |          | @MikeBrown \#Foodie #Fitness \#Learning                                             |
  | 2        | Just had the best dinner with friends! \#Foodie #Friends #Fun                      |
  | 4        | Working hard on my new project \#Work \#Goals \#Productivity \#Fun                    |
  +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
  +----------+
  | tweet_id |
  +----------+
  | 1        |
  | 4        |
  +----------+
```

**Explanation:**

- tweet_id 1 contains 4 mentions.
- tweet_id 4 contains 4 hashtags.

Output table is ordered by tweet_id in ascending order.

I'll solve this SQL problem step by step.

Step 1: Understanding the problem  
We need to identify invalid tweets based on three criteria:  

1. The tweet exceeds 140 characters
2. The tweet has more than 3 mentions (@username)
3. The tweet has more than 3 hashtags (\#tag)

Let's solve each criterion separately and then combine them.

Step 2: Check tweets that exceed 140 characters

```SQL
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 140
```

Explanation: This part simply checks if the length of the content exceeds 140 characters.

Step 3: Check tweets with more than 3 mentions  
To count mentions (@username), we need to find all occurrences of the pattern "@" followed by a word character.  

Step 4: Check tweets with more than 3 hashtags  
Similarly, we'll count hashtags (\#tag) by finding all occurrences of "#" followed by a word character.  

Let's put it all together:

Wait, let me correct my approach. The solution I provided won't correctly count mentions and hashtags. Let me revise it with a more accurate approach:

Let me revise the solution again with a clearer explanation:

Let me explain this SQL solution step by step:

Step 1: Understanding the Problem  
We need to identify tweets that are invalid according to any of these three criteria:  

1. The tweet exceeds 140 characters in length
2. The tweet contains more than 3 mentions (@username)
3. The tweet contains more than 3 hashtags (\#tag)

Step 2: Checking Tweet Length

```SQL
LENGTH(content) > 140
```

Explanation: This simple condition checks if the length of the tweet content exceeds 140 characters.

Step 3: Counting Mentions

```SQL
(LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '@', ''))) > 3
```

Explanation: This approach counts the number of '@' symbols in the content:

- First, it calculates the original length of the content using LENGTH(content)
- Then it removes all '@' symbols using REPLACE(content, '@', '')
- The difference between these two lengths equals the number of '@' symbols
- If this count is greater than 3, the tweet violates the mention limit

Step 4: Counting Hashtags

```SQL
(LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '#', ''))) > 3
```

Explanation: Similar to counting mentions, this condition:

- Calculates the difference between the original content length and the length after removing all '#' symbols
- If this difference is greater than 3, the tweet has more than 3 hashtags

Step 5: Combining All Conditions

```SQL
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE
    LENGTH(content) > 140
    OR (LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '@', ''))) > 3
    OR (LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '#', ''))) > 3
ORDER BY tweet_id;
```

Explanation: The final query:

- Selects tweet_id from the Tweets table
- Uses OR to combine all three criteria (a tweet is invalid if it violates ANY of the criteria)
- Orders the results by tweet_id in ascending order as required

Note: This solution assumes that every '@' and '#' in the content represents an actual mention or hashtag. While this might not be 100% accurate (for example, if '@' appears in an email address), it works for the given examples and problem statement.

In the example data:

- Tweet 1 contains 4 mentions (@JaneSmith, @SaraJohnson, @LisaTaylor, @MikeBrown), exceeding the limit of 3
- Tweet 4 contains 4 hashtags (\#Work, \#Goals, \#Productivity, \#Fun), exceeding the limit of 3
- Both tweets are correctly identified as invalid

```SQL
-- Solution for counting mentions and hashtags
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE 
    -- Criterion 1: Check if tweet exceeds 140 characters
    LENGTH(content) > 140
    
    -- Criterion 2: Check if tweet has more than 3 mentions
    OR (LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '@', ''))) > 3
    
    -- Criterion 3: Check if tweet has more than 3 hashtags
    OR (LENGTH(content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(content, '#', ''))) > 3
    
ORDER BY tweet_id;
```
