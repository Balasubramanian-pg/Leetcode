**Description**

Table: `Emails`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
```

Write a solution to find all **unique email domains** and count the number of **individuals** associated with each domain. **Consider only** those domains that **end** with **.com**.

Return _the result table orderd by email domains in_ **ascending** _order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Emails table:
+-----+-----------------------+
| id  | email                 |
+-----+-----------------------+
| 336 | hwkiy@test.edu        |
| 489 | adcmaf@outlook.com    |
| 449 | vrzmwyum@yahoo.com    |
| 95  | tof@test.edu          |
| 320 | jxhbagkpm@example.org |
| 411 | zxcf@outlook.com      |
+----+------------------------+
Output:
+--------------+-------+
| email_domain | count |
+--------------+-------+
| outlook.com  | 2     |
| yahoo.com    | 1     |
+--------------+-------+
Explanation:
- The valid domains ending with ".com" are only "outlook.com" and "yahoo.com", with respective counts of 2 and 1.
Output table is ordered by email_domains in ascending order.
```

To solve this SQL problem, we need to:

### **Objective**

Find all **unique email domains** ending with `.com` and count the number of users for each.

---

### **Step-by-Step Approach**

### **Step 1: Extract the domain**

Use `SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1)` to extract the domain part from the email address.

### **Step 2: Filter domains ending with** `**.com**`

Use `WHERE domain LIKE '%.com'` to include only `.com` domains.

### **Step 3: Group and count**

Group by the domain and count the number of users.

### **Step 4: Order alphabetically**

Sort by domain in ascending order.

---

### **Final SQL Query**

```SQL
SELECT
    SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1) AS email_domain,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM Emails
WHERE SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1) LIKE '%.com'
GROUP BY email_domain
ORDER BY email_domain;
```

---

### **Explanation**

- `SUBSTRING_INDEX(email, '@', -1)` extracts everything after the `@`.
- The `LIKE '%.com'` ensures we only count `.com` domains.
- `GROUP BY` and `COUNT(*)` aggregate the results.
- `ORDER BY` ensures the result is sorted lexicographically by domain.

Do you need this solution optimized for a large dataset or implemented in a specific SQL dialect like BigQuery or PostgreSQL?
