Table: `Patients`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| patient_id   | int     |
| patient_name | varchar |
| conditions   | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
patient_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
'conditions' contains 0 or more code separated by spaces.
This table contains information of the patients in the hospital.
```

Write a solution to find the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions  
of the patients who have Type I Diabetes. Type I Diabetes always starts  
with  
`DIAB1` prefix.

Return the result table in **any order**.

TheÂ result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Patients table:
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Output:
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.
```

# Finding Patients with Type I Diabetes

To solve this problem, I need to identify patients whose conditions include Type I Diabetes, which is indicated by a condition code that starts with "DIAB1". The challenge is that these codes can appear anywhere in the space-separated conditions string.

## Approach

1. **Pattern Matching**: Look for "DIAB1" at the start of any condition in the string
2. **String Search**: The condition could be:
    - At the beginning of the string ("DIAB100 MYOP")
    - After a space ("ACNE DIAB100")
3. **Regular Expression**: Use a regex that matches either:
    - Beginning of string followed by "DIAB1"
    - A space followed by "DIAB1"

## Solution Code

```SQL
SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions
FROM Patients
WHERE conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%' OR conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%';
```

## Explanation

- `conditions LIKE 'DIAB1%'` matches conditions where DIAB1 appears at the start
- `conditions LIKE '% DIAB1%'` matches conditions where DIAB1 appears after a space
- Combined with OR, this catches DIAB1 codes anywhere in the conditions string
- In the example:
    - Bob matches with "DIAB100 MYOP" (starts with DIAB1)
    - George matches with "ACNE DIAB100" (DIAB1 after space)
    - Others don't have DIAB1 in their conditions

This solution efficiently identifies Type I Diabetes patients using simple string pattern matching that covers all possible positions of the DIAB1 code in the conditions field.
