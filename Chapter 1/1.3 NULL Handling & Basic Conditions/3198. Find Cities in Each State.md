**Description**

Table: `cities`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| state       | varchar |
| city        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(state, city) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.
```

Write a solution to find **all the cities in each state** and combine them into a **single comma-separated** string.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `state` _and_ `city` _in **ascending** order_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example:**

**Input:**

cities table:

```Plain
+-------------+---------------+
| state       | city          |
+-------------+---------------+
| California  | Los Angeles   |
| California  | San Francisco |
| California  | San Diego     |
| Texas       | Houston       |
| Texas       | Austin        |
| Texas       | Dallas        |
| New York    | New York City |
| New York    | Buffalo       |
| New York    | Rochester     |
+-------------+---------------+
```

**Output:**

```Plain
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| state       | cities                                |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
| California  | Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco |
| New York    | Buffalo, New York City, Rochester     |
| Texas       | Austin, Dallas, Houston               |
+-------------+---------------------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

- **California:** All cities ("Los Angeles", "San Diego", "San Francisco") are listed in a comma-separated string.
- **New York:** All cities ("Buffalo", "New York City", "Rochester") are listed in a comma-separated string.
- **Texas:** All cities ("Austin", "Dallas", "Houston") are listed in a comma-separated string.

**Note:** The output table is ordered by the state name in ascending order.

## Solutions

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution, explaining each part in detail with **subpoints** and **plain language**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to:

1. Group cities by their respective states.
2. Combine all cities within each state into a **single comma-separated string**.
3. Order the result by **state** and **city** in ascending order.

**Key Points:**

- Use `GROUP BY` to group cities by state.
- Use string aggregation functions to combine city names.
- Order the final result by state and city.

---

### **Step 2: Group Cities by State**

First, group the cities by their state.

```SQL
SELECT
    state
FROM
    cities
GROUP BY
    state;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**GROUP BY state**`: Groups all rows by the `state` column.

---

### **Step 3: Combine City Names into a Single String**

Next, concatenate all city names within each state into a comma-separated string.

```SQL
SELECT
    state,
    GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities
FROM
    cities
GROUP BY
    state
ORDER BY
    state ASC;
```

**Explanation:**

- `**GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ')**`:
    - Combines city names into a single string.
    - `ORDER BY city ASC`: Sorts city names alphabetically within the string.
    - `SEPARATOR ', '`: Uses a comma and space as the separator between city names.
- `**GROUP BY state**`: Groups the results by state.
- `**ORDER BY state ASC**`: Orders the final result by state in ascending order.

---

### **Final Solution**

```SQL
SELECT
    state,
    GROUP_CONCAT(city ORDER BY city ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS cities
FROM
    cities
GROUP BY
    state
ORDER BY
    state ASC;
```

**Final Explanation:**

1. **Grouping**: The `GROUP BY state` clause groups all cities by their respective states.
2. **String Aggregation**: The `GROUP_CONCAT` function combines city names into a comma-separated string, sorted alphabetically.
3. **Ordering**: The `ORDER BY state ASC` clause ensures the final result is ordered by state in ascending order.

This query returns the desired output, where each state has its cities combined into a single comma-separated string, ordered by state.
