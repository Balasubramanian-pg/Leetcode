**Description**

Table: `Candidates`

```Plain
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| candidate_id | int     |
| skill        | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
(candidate_id, skill) is the primary key (columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row includes candidate_id and skill.
```

Write a query to find the **candidates** best suited for a Data Scientist position. The candidate must be proficient in **Python**, **Tableau**, and **PostgreSQL**.

Return _the result table ordered by_ `candidate_id` _in **ascending order**_.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Candidates table:
+---------------+--------------+
| candidate_id  | skill        |
+---------------+--------------+
| 123           | Python       |
| 234           | R            |
| 123           | Tableau      |
| 123           | PostgreSQL   |
| 234           | PowerBI      |
| 234           | SQL Server   |
| 147           | Python       |
| 147           | Tableau      |
| 147           | Java         |
| 147           | PostgreSQL   |
| 256           | Tableau      |
| 102           | DataAnalysis |
+---------------+--------------+
Output:
+--------------+
| candidate_id |
+--------------+
| 123          |
| 147          |
+--------------+
Explanation:
- Candidates 123 and 147 possess the necessary skills in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL for the data scientist position.
- Candidates 234 and 102 do not possess any of the required skills for this position.
- Candidate 256 has proficiency in Tableau but is missing skills in Python and PostgreSQL.
The output table is sorted by candidate_id in ascending order.
```

## Solutions

### Problem Understanding

We are given a table of candidates and their skills.

We need to **find candidate IDs** of those who have **all three skills**:

- `'Python'`
- `'Tableau'`
- `'PostgreSQL'`

---

We'll build the query step-by-step.

---

### Step 1: Select Only Relevant Skills

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id, skill
FROM Candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
```

**Explanation:**

We start by filtering the rows to only include candidates who have at least one of the three required skills. This simplifies further processing.

---

### Step 2: Count Distinct Required Skills per Candidate

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id, COUNT(DISTINCT skill) AS matched_skills
FROM Candidates
WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id
```

**Explanation:**

We group by each `candidate_id` and count how many of the required skills they have. If they have **all three**, the count will be 3.

---

### Step 3: Filter Candidates Who Have All 3 Required Skills

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id
FROM (
  SELECT candidate_id, COUNT(DISTINCT skill) AS matched_skills
  FROM Candidates
  WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
  GROUP BY candidate_id
) AS SkillMatch
WHERE matched_skills = 3
```

**Explanation:**

Now, from the grouped data, we pick only those candidates who have exactly **3 matched skills**â€”that is, all required ones.

---

### Step 4: Sort the Results by Candidate ID

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id
FROM (
  SELECT candidate_id, COUNT(DISTINCT skill) AS matched_skills
  FROM Candidates
  WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
  GROUP BY candidate_id
) AS SkillMatch
WHERE matched_skills = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id
```

**Explanation:**

Final step: return the candidate IDs sorted in ascending order, as asked in the question.

---

### Final Solution

```SQL
SELECT candidate_id
FROM (
  SELECT candidate_id, COUNT(DISTINCT skill) AS matched_skills
  FROM Candidates
  WHERE skill IN ('Python', 'Tableau', 'PostgreSQL')
  GROUP BY candidate_id
) AS SkillMatch
WHERE matched_skills = 3
ORDER BY candidate_id
```

Let me know if you'd like a version using `HAVING` instead of a subquery.
