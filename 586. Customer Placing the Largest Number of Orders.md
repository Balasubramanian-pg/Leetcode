Table: `Orders`

```Plain
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
```

Write a solution to find the `customer_number` for the customer who has placed **the largest number of orders**.

The test cases are generated so that **exactly one customer** will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output:
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation:
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order.
So the result is customer_number 3.
```

**Follow up:** What if more than one customer has the largest number of orders, can you find all the `customer_number` in this case?

# Finding Customer with Most Orders

To solve this problem, I need to identify the customer who has placed the most orders. The straightforward solution works when there's exactly one customer with the maximum orders, while the follow-up considers cases where multiple customers might tie for the highest order count.

## Solution for Exactly One Top Customer

```SQL
SELECT customer_number
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Solution for Handling Multiple Top Customers (Follow-up)

```SQL
WITH OrderCounts AS (
    SELECT
        customer_number,
        COUNT(*) AS num_orders
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
)
SELECT customer_number
FROM OrderCounts
WHERE num_orders = (SELECT MAX(num_orders) FROM OrderCounts);
```

## Explanation

1. **Basic Solution**:
    - Groups orders by customer_number
    - Counts orders for each customer
    - Orders results by order count (descending)
    - Returns just the top customer with LIMIT 1
2. **Follow-up Solution**:
    - First creates a CTE (Common Table Expression) counting orders per customer
    - Then finds the maximum order count from these results
    - Returns all customers who have this maximum count
    - Handles ties by returning all top customers

Example 1 Output:

```Plain
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
```

The basic solution is optimal when the problem guarantees a single top customer, while the follow-up solution is more robust for general cases where multiple customers might tie for the highest order count. Both solutions efficiently aggregate and analyze the order data to identify the most frequent customers.
