**Description**

Table: `Files`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-- ----------+---------+
| file_name   | varchar |
| content     | text    |
+-------------+---------+
file_name is the column with unique values of this table.
Each row contains file_name and the content of that file.
```

Write a solution to find the number of files that have at least one occurrence of the words **'bull'** and **'bear'** as a **standalone word**,  
respectively, disregarding any instances where it appears without space  
on either side (e.g. 'bullet', 'bears', 'bull.', or 'bear' at the  
beginning or end of a sentence will **not** be considered)

Return _the word 'bull' and 'bear' along with the corresponding number of occurrences in **any order.**_

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Files table:
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| file_name  | content                                                                         |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| draft1.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy. |
| draft2.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, |
|            | but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are    |
|            | awaiting a bear market.                                                          |
| draft3.txt | The stock exchange predicts a bull market which would make many investors happy, |
|            | but analysts warn of possibility of too much optimism and that in fact we are    |
|            | awaiting a bear market. As always predicting the future market is an uncertain   |
|            | game and all investors should follow their instincts and best practices.         |
+------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Output:
+------+-------+
| word | count |
+------+-------+
| bull | 3     |
| bear | 2     |
+------+-------+
Explanation:
- The word "bull" appears 1 time in "draft1.txt", 1 time in "draft2.txt", and 1 time in "draft3.txt". Therefore, the total number of occurrences for the word "bull" is 3.
- The word "bear" appears 1 time in "draft2.txt", and 1 time in "draft3.txt". Therefore, the total number of occurrences for the word "bear" is 2.

```

## Solutions

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. The goal is to count how many times the exact words 'bull' and 'bear' appear in the `content` of all files. The rule for counting is a bit specific: we should only count 'bull' or 'bear' when they appear as whole, separate words. The examples show that words followed by punctuation like a period or comma _should_ be counted, but words that are part of a larger word (like 'bullet') should not.

A good way to handle this is to standardize the text first by treating certain punctuation marks as word separators, and then pad the text with spaces so we can simply search for the word surrounded by spaces, like `' bull '` or `' bear '`.

Step 1: We need to process the `content` of each file. The problem implies that words followed by punctuation (like ',', '.') should still be considered "standalone". To make counting easier, we can replace these common punctuation marks within the content with spaces. This way, a word followed by a comma, like `bull,`, will become `bull` , making it easier to find as a word separated by spaces.

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        -- Replace common punctuation with spaces to help identify standalone words
        REPLACE(
            REPLACE(
                REPLACE(
                    REPLACE(
                        REPLACE(content, ',', ' '),
                    '.', ' '),
                '!', ' '),
            '?', ' '),
        ';', ' ') AS cleaned_content
    FROM Files
)
-- This first step creates a temporary result set (CTE) where we've replaced commas, periods,
-- exclamation marks, question marks, and semicolons in the file content with spaces.
```

Explanation: We create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `CleanedContent`. For each row in the `Files` table, we select the `file_name` and apply several `REPLACE` functions to the `content` column. We replace commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks, and semicolons with single spaces. This helps ensure that words like "bull," are treated as "bull " for easier counting later.

Step 2: To correctly count words that appear at the very beginning or end of the file content, we can add a space to the start and end of the `cleaned_content`. After this padding, searching for a word surrounded by spaces (e.g., `' bull '`) will correctly find the word whether it was originally at the start, end, or middle of the content (assuming it was separated by spaces or the punctuation we replaced).

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
PaddedCleanedContent AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        -- Add a space to the beginning and end of the cleaned content
        ' ' || cleaned_content || ' ' AS padded_content
    FROM CleanedContent
)
-- This CTE takes the cleaned content from the previous step and adds a space character
-- at the very beginning and end. This makes it simpler to search for words surrounded by spaces,
-- including those originally at the start or end of the content.
```

Explanation: We create a second CTE `PaddedCleanedContent`. We select the `file_name` and concatenate (`||`) a space before and after the `cleaned_content` from the previous CTE. This creates a new column `padded_content` where every file's content is guaranteed to start and end with a space.

Step 3: Now that the content is cleaned and padded, we can count the occurrences of the exact strings `' bull '` and `' bear '` in the `padded_content` for each file. A standard SQL way to count substring occurrences is using the `LENGTH` and `REPLACE` functions.

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
PaddedCleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FileWordCounts AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        -- Calculate the number of times ' bull ' appears:
        -- Find original length, subtract length after removing ' bull ', divide by length of ' bull '
        (LENGTH(padded_content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(padded_content, ' bull ', ''))) / LENGTH(' bull ') AS bull_count_per_file,
        -- Calculate the number of times ' bear ' appears similarly
        (LENGTH(padded_content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(padded_content, ' bear ', ''))) / LENGTH(' bear ') AS bear_count_per_file
    FROM PaddedCleanedContent
)
-- This CTE calculates, for each file, how many times the words 'bull' and 'bear'
-- appeared as standalone words (surrounded by spaces in the padded content).
```

Explanation: We create a third CTE `FileWordCounts`. For each file, we calculate the count of ' bull ' and ' bear '.

- `LENGTH(padded_content)` gets the total length of the string.
- `REPLACE(padded_content, ' bull ', '')` removes all instances of the exact substring `' bull '`.
- The difference `LENGTH(padded_content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(...))` gives the total length of all removed `' bull '` substrings.
- Dividing this difference by `LENGTH(' bull ')` (which is 6) gives the total count of occurrences. The same logic is applied for `' bear '`.

Step 4: The final output requires the _total_ number of times 'bull' and 'bear' appeared across _all_ files. We need to sum up the counts calculated in the previous step across all files.

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
PaddedCleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FileWordCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
TotalWordCounts AS (
    SELECT
        SUM(bull_count_per_file) AS total_bull,
        SUM(bear_count_per_file) AS total_bear
    FROM FileWordCounts
)
-- This CTE calculates the grand total count for 'bull' and 'bear' across all files
-- by summing up the counts from the FileWordCounts CTE.
```

Explanation: We create a fourth CTE `TotalWordCounts`. We use the `SUM()` aggregate function to calculate the total sum of the `bull_count_per_file` values and the total sum of the `bear_count_per_file` values from all rows in the `FileWordCounts` CTE.

Step 5: Finally, we need to present the results in the required format: two rows, one for 'bull' and its total count, and one for 'bear' and its total count. We can use `UNION ALL` to combine two select statements that retrieve the total counts from the `TotalWordCounts` CTE.

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 1
PaddedCleanedContent AS ( ... ), -- from step 2
FileWordCounts AS ( ... ), -- from step 3
TotalWordCounts AS ( ... ) -- from step 4
-- Select the word 'bull' and its total count
SELECT
    'bull' AS word,
    total_bull AS count
FROM TotalWordCounts

UNION ALL -- Combine this result with the result for 'bear'

-- Select the word 'bear' and its total count
SELECT
    'bear' AS word,
    total_bear AS count
FROM TotalWordCounts;
-- This final step formats the total counts into the desired output table structure.
```

Explanation: We select from the `TotalWordCounts` CTE. The first `SELECT` hardcodes the string 'bull' and selects the `total_bull` count. The second `SELECT` hardcodes 'bear' and selects `total_bear`. `UNION ALL` combines these two single-row results into the final output table.

Final Solution:

```SQL
WITH CleanedContent AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        REPLACE(
            REPLACE(
                REPLACE(
                    REPLACE(
                        REPLACE(content, ',', ' '),
                    '.', ' '),
                '!', ' '),
            '?', ' '),
        ';', ' ') AS cleaned_content
    FROM Files
),
PaddedCleanedContent AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        ' ' || cleaned_content || ' ' AS padded_content
    FROM CleanedContent
),
FileWordCounts AS (
    SELECT
        file_name,
        (LENGTH(padded_content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(padded_content, ' bull ', ''))) / LENGTH(' bull ') AS bull_count_per_file,
        (LENGTH(padded_content) - LENGTH(REPLACE(padded_content, ' bear ', ''))) / LENGTH(' bear ') AS bear_count_per_file
    FROM PaddedCleanedContent
),
TotalWordCounts AS (
    SELECT
        SUM(bull_count_per_file) AS total_bull,
        SUM(bear_count_per_file) AS total_bear
    FROM FileWordCounts
)
SELECT
    'bull' AS word,
    total_bull AS count
FROM TotalWordCounts

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'bear' AS word,
    total_bear AS count
FROM TotalWordCounts;
