**Description**

Table: `Friendship`

```Plain
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that there is a friendship relation between user1_id and user2_id.
```

Table: `Likes`

```Plain
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| page_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(user_id, page_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that user_id likes page_id.
```

Write a solution to recommend pages to the user with `user_id = 1` using the pages that your friends liked. It should not recommend pages you already liked.

Return result table in **any order** without duplicates.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```Plain
Input:
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |
+----------+----------+
Likes table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | page_id |
+---------+---------+
| 1       | 88      |
| 2       | 23      |
| 3       | 24      |
| 4       | 56      |
| 5       | 11      |
| 6       | 33      |
| 2       | 77      |
| 3       | 77      |
| 6       | 88      |
+---------+---------+
Output:
+------------------+
| recommended_page |
+------------------+
| 23               |
| 24               |
| 56               |
| 33               |
| 77               |
+------------------+
Explanation:
User one is friend with users 2, 3, 4 and 6.
Suggested pages are 23 from user 2, 24 from user 3, 56 from user 3 and 33 from user 6.
Page 77 is suggested from both user 2 and user 3.
Page 88 is not suggested because user 1 already likes it.
```

**Solutions**

**Solution 1: Union + Equi-Join + Subquery**

First, we query all users who are friends with `user_id = 1` and record them in the `T` table. Then, we query all pages that users in the `T` table like, and finally exclude the pages that `user_id = 1` likes.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Friends of User 1**
    - **Task**: Find all users who are friends with `user_id = 1`.
    - **Action**: Look at the `Friendship` table and list all friends. This involves checking both columns (`user1_id` and `user2_id`) because friendships can be recorded in either direction.
    - **Result**: A list of friend IDs.
2. **Gather Liked Pages by Friends**
    - **Task**: Collect all the pages liked by the friends identified in Step 1.
    - **Action**: Use the list of friend IDs to find corresponding entries in the `Likes` table.
    - **Result**: A list of pages liked by friends.
3. **Filter Out Already Liked Pages**
    - **Task**: Remove pages from the list that `user_id = 1` already likes.
    - **Action**: Check the `Likes` table for pages liked by `user_id = 1` and exclude these from the list gathered in Step 2.
    - **Result**: A final list of recommended pages that are new to `user_id = 1`.
4. **Return Recommended Pages**
    - **Task**: Provide the final list of recommended pages.
    - **Action**: Ensure the list is free of duplicates and return it.
    - **Result**: The output list of recommended pages.

### Simplified SQL Query

Here's how the SQL query reflects these steps:

```SQL
WITH Friends AS (
    SELECT user1_id AS friend_id
    FROM Friendship
    WHERE user2_id = 1
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id AS friend_id
    FROM Friendship
    WHERE user1_id = 1
)
SELECT DISTINCT L.page_id AS recommended_page
FROM Likes L
JOIN Friends F ON L.user_id = F.friend_id
WHERE L.page_id NOT IN (
    SELECT page_id
    FROM Likes
    WHERE user_id = 1
);
```

### Explanation of the Query

1. **Friends CTE**: This part finds all friends of `user_id = 1` by looking at both directions of the friendship.
2. **Main Query**:
    - Joins the `Likes` table with the `Friends` list to get pages liked by friends.
    - Filters out pages that `user_id = 1` already likes.
    - Uses `DISTINCT` to remove any duplicate page recommendations.

This breakdown should make the process clearer and easier to understand!
